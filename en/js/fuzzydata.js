The Build periodically function of Jenkins is the Scheduling builds function on Bitrise. A big advantage of Bitrise is that you don’t have to set up a cron job, like you would on Jenkins, to schedule a specific time. Instead, select a day\/s from the timeline and type an hour and month. No confusion over cron expressions any more! For any Git related events, such as code push, pull requests, and Git tags, you can configure triggers that automatically start a build on Bitrise. The Build after other projects function of Jenkins is equivalent to the chaining Workflows together on Bitrise where the Workflows run in succession. It’s surprisingly easy to chain Workflows together on Bitrise. You can trigger builds by any other remote system: use Webhooks. We’re integrated with GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket, Gogs, Slack, Visual Studio, Assembla, Deveo. You can also push back build status reports to your Git provider (GitHub\/GitLab\/Bitbucket). " },

"body" : "A Step is a pre-defined task in Bitrise just like the Jenkins Steps, however, a Bitrise Step can be easily configured on our intuitive UI or you can even pull in your own Step from your repository. You can configure the inputs and parameters that define a Step task, and view\/reuse the outputs a Step generates. Reusing the output means that another Step in the same Workflow can use it as the value of one of its inputs. As being a continuous integration tool itself, Jenkins integrates with other services with the help of plugins. Jenkins users have to manage plugins in a centralized place, called Manage plugins , install them globally (on their Jenkins server), then use them in their specific projects. If Jenkins notifies of a newer plugin version, Jenkins admins have to doublecheck with their teams if they’re running any builds since updating a plugin requires the server to restart. With Jenkins plugins, reverting to an older version is not possible, since only the latest version is available. In Bitrise, however, you do not have to install any Steps first, because you can add or remove any Step in your Bitrise Workflow at any time as you wish and it won’t block any running builds of the project. You can always revert back to a previous Step version too if that’s what you need. What’s more: When editing your Workflow in the Workflow Editor , you can easily search for a Step based on functionality or platform you are looking for in the Step Library and add it to your Workflow straightaway - there is no need to install them prior to setting up your Workflow. You can create your own custom Step too and store in a repository, then you can reference it by a URL in your Workflow. A Step jolly joker: our Script Step Do you have a custom script you’d like to run in your Workflow? Select the Script Step from the Step Library and add your custom code to the Script content input.

"body" : "A Jenkins Pipeline is equivalent to a Bitrise Workflow , but the Bitrise Workflows are much easier to manage: you can quickly create new Workflows based on existing ones, chain multiple Workflows together in a single build, or delete Workflows that you no longer need. A Bitrise Workflow is a series of Steps, such as test, code sign, build APK\/ ipa and deploy. When you add an app to Bitrise, a primary Workflow, created based on the project scanner’s findings, gets kicked off\/triggered automatically. You can have several Workflows for a certain project. For example: For any PR events, create a Workflow that, once triggered, runs quickly and only executes basic tests such as smoke tests. For a meatier Workflow, that runs all your test, we recommend creating another Workflow and run it overnight or schedule it on 6\/12\/24 hour interval. The Workflow Editor is the main place for configuring your Workflow. Jenkins Stages are equal to multiple Bitrise Workflows chained together inside a main Workflow. On Bitrise the Workflow Editor helps you to chain Workflows like one would chain toy trains after each other. The Workflow Editor has other powerful features built in to assist you with mobile development: Code signing : one-stop shop to store and manage all your code signing files which then will be used by the Workflow. Again, no need for installing a code signing tool first like in Jenkins. You can store any custom file here too (in the GENERIC FILE STORAGE section) which the Generic File Storage Step can download. Secrets: check out your app’s secret Environment Variables or add new ones. Environment Variables: there is no confusion of secrets and Env Vars in Bitrise. They are neatly organized into separate tabs so that you know where’s what. Add App Env Vars or Workflow specific Env Vars here. You can also reference Secrets as Env Vars with $. Triggers : You can configure triggers: code push events, pull requests, or tags can all be set up to automatically start builds on Bitrise. Stack : Check out the default stack of your app, select a new one from a dropdown menu or select a specific stack for one of your Workflows. " },

"body" : "You can run your fastlane lane on Bitrise with the same commands you would use locally. Bitrise’s automated Steps provide extra functionality to your lane and speed up your builds. Here is how you can benefit from integrating fastlane into Bitrise. Our Fastlane Match Step takes care of code signing your project by cloning your private certificate\/profile repository and registering the certificates and profiles in the keychain. On Bitrise, you can run separate lanes for separate branches automatically. For example, you can run a lane for every code push onto the main branch to update screenshots and metadata on the App Store and to release the distribution version. You can run a separate lane for the develop branch to run your automated tests and deploy your test releases for your QA team. You can simply clone the Workflow multiple times, specify the lane to run for the given Workflow in a Workflow Specific Environment Variable, and use automatic triggers to define which Workflow should be selected for this branch \/ tag \/ pull request. Running fastlane on Bitrise is as simple as adding one Step to your Workflow and setting some options. Let’s see how! Connect to Apple services Do not forget to connect to Apple services if you use this Step in your Workflow. Add the Fastlane Step to your Workflow. Make sure it is inserted after the Git Clone Step. Since fastlane is pre-installed on all Bitrise’s virtual machines, the Fastlane Step ensures that you can always use the required fastlane version. To code sign your project, you have a couple of options to choose from: Add one of Bitrise’s code signing Steps to your Workflow, such as: Certificate and profile installer , Manage iOS Code Signing , and Fastlane Match . For more information, check out our Code signing guides . Alternatively, use fastlane match inside your fastlane lane instead of a code signing Step. Make sure you either use the Fastlane Match Step or set up fastlane match in your lane but don’t try to do both. Click the Fastlane Step to fill out the required fields. Add your lane in the fastlane lane input. Use Working directory field if the fastlane directory is not in your repository’s root. The working directory should be the parent directory of your Fastfile ’s directory. For example, if the Fastfile path is .\/here\/is\/my\/fastlane\/Fastfile , then the Fastfile ’s directory is .\/here\/is\/my\/fastlane , so the Working Directory should be .\/here\/is\/my . The Should update fastlane gem before run? option will be skipped if you have a Gemfile in the work_dir directory. If you don’t have a Gemfile and this option is enabled, then the Step tries to use and run the latest fastlane version. Set the Enable verbose logging? to yes if you wish to get more detailed logs on your failed builds. If the Enable collecting files to be included in build cache is set to yes , the Step adds the following cache items (if they exist): Pods - Podfile.lock Carthage - Cartfile.resolved Android dependencies That’s it! Start a build so that Bitrise can run your lane. Reducing dependency on fastlane Check out some of our Steps, which you can use to enhance your Bitrise experience, increasing the speed of your builds and simplifying processes while reducing your dependency on fastlane: Xcode Archive & Export for iOS : This Step archives your Xcode project into an .ipa file that can be shared, installed on test devices, or uploaded to the App Store Connect. This Step also sets up code signing automatically with nearly zero configuration. Xcode test for iOS : This Step runs all Xcode tests that are included in your project. Xcode build for testing for iOS , iOS Device Testing , and Virtual Device Testing for Android : These Steps take care of all your device, unit, or UI testing needs. You can run tests using either a simulator or a physical device. Google Play Deploy : You can use this Step to upload your Android app to Google Play. " },

"body" : "Adding an app to Bitrise means setting up access to your repository so that you can run builds. Our project scanner determines the platform type and generates default Workflows to build and deploy your app. Adding an app to Bitrise means setting up access to your repository so that you can run builds. During the process, we also run our project scanner that detects the platform type of your app - for example, iOS - and generate default Workflows with all the necessary Steps to build and deploy your app. Currently we are supporting the following platforms\/frameworks out of the box: The project scanner Supporting a platform\/framework means that our project scanner can detect the type of the app and set up a basic Bitrise configuration based on the type. You can add any other app, too, regardless of how it's built but you'll have to configure it manually. Android iOS React Native Flutter Ionic\/Cordova MacOS In this guide we describe how you can add a new app to Bitrise, connect your repository to Bitrise, set up SSH keys and initial configuration, and register a webhook . Log in to Bitrise. Click the Add your first app button. Under CHOOSE ACCOUNT , select the Workspace that will own the app. Set the privacy of the app. You cannot change this setting later! If you realize you've accidentally added your app as a public app even though you need it to be private, you'll have to delete the app and add it again. Private apps are only accessible to you, your Workspace members and those who are invited to work on an app. They require authentication to access the repository of the app. Public apps  expose their  bitrise.yml and their build logs to everyone. If you have a public app’s build URL, you can view its build log, to help with troubleshooting, for example. Public apps do not require authentication and they cannot have SSH keys. Select one of two options to set your repository URL: With the Select remote repository option, you can select a repository from a list of repos from a connected Git provider account. If you do not have a connected Git provider account, you can still select a provider from the dropdown menu and then click Connect account . The Enter URL manually option does not require a connected Git provider account: you can simply enter the URL and proceed to the authentication phase. We strongly recommend using an SSH URL, unless you are setting up a public app . Repository URL You will be able to change your project's repository URL later. You can also connect or disconnect your account to Git provider services at any time. If you signed up for Bitrise using a Git provider account, that one is already connected and you can select any of your repositories from it. Add an SSH key in the Setup repository access section. This is only relevant for private apps: public apps can't have SSH keys and they don't require authentication. Configure SSH keys at any time If you can't set up a valid, working SSH key connection at this time, don't worry: proceed with adding your app. You can set up the SSH connection afterwards. We recommend the default option: click No, auto-add SSH key . Your connected source code hosting service account (for example, your GitHub account) must have admin rights to the repository. If it does, Bitrise will automatically add the SSH key. If you need to use additional private repositories, or you don't have admin rights to the repository, click the I need to button. Copy the public SSH key and get it added to the repository. Once you're done, click I've added the SSH key . You can also use your own SSH keys. On the right of the Setup repository access section, select ADD OWN SSH . Paste your RSA SSH private key to the field below without the passphrase. You will have to register the public key at your source code hosting service. Enter a branch of your repository, then click Next . Bitrise will run your first build on this branch and it will be set as your Bitrise app's default branch but you can change this setting later . This branch should contain the configuration of your project. Wait while Bitrise is attempting to automatically configure your app. Bitrise can detect your project type, and set up a stack and default Workflows based on that. Project type Detecting a project type serves to assist in the initial configuration of your app. But don't worry, you can change every setting, including the project type, at any time after you added the app. If Bitrise successfully detected your project type, proceed to the next Step. If Bitrise failed to detect your project type, you have two options. Try to fix the issue that caused the project scanner to fail. The logs we provide might be helpful. Once you're done select Retry automatic configuration . Select Skip and configure manually . You'll need to choose the project type, and set up the project configuration based on the type you chose. If you select Other\/Manual , you'll just need to select a stack type. Confirm the project build configuration and click I'm ready when done. The exact configuration options depend on your project type. You will always have the option to select a stack and the machine types for the selected stack. If you're not sure about these options, don't worry: you can change them later . Optionally, add an app icon by uploading an image. You can skip this and add an icon later if you wish. Optionally, allow Bitrise to set up a webhook in your repository. You need a webhook to automatically trigger builds . You can set up webhooks for your apps at any time so feel free to skip it for now. Once you register a webhook (or skip it), Bitrise automatically starts your app's first build.

You can create a signed APK using the  Android Sign   Step in your Bitrise Workflow . This Step is configured to run if you have already uploaded your keystore file on the  Code Signing  tab of the Workflow Editor. The  Android Sign  Step is not required if signing is configured in your project’s build.gradle file. If so, running the  Android Build Step (or the  Gradle Runner  Step) signs the output (APK or AAB) automatically. Nevertheless, we recommend that you use the  Android Sign  Step to sign your project in an easy and secure way. jarsign and apksigner APKs can be signed with either jarsigner or apksigner . For APKs, if you wish to use apksigner to sign your project, then in the Android Sign Step you have to first set the Enables apksigner input to true and leave the APK Signature Scheme input on automatic. This way apksigner checks your APK’s minimum and target SDK versions and chooses the required schemes. It signs your project with V1 scheme if your minimum supported version is low and it also signs with other schemes for newer systems. Please note that AAB files can only be signed with jarsigner. The Step uses jarsigner if it detects a file ending with  .aab Open your app on Bitrise . Click the Workflows button on the main page. Go to Code Signing > Android Code Signing . Drag-and-drop your keystore file to the  Upload file  field of the  ANDROID KEYSTORE FILE  section. A keystore URL automatically gets generated once you upload the keystore file. Bitrise assigns an Environment Variable ( BITRISEIO_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_URL ) to the download URL (which is a time-limited, read-only download URL) of the file as the value. No need to download it manually as the Android Sign Step downloads it automatically. Fill out the displayed three input fields with your credentials: Keystore password Keystore alias Private key password Click Save metadata . When you have successfully uploaded a keystore file to the ANDROID KEYSTORE FILE section, Bitrise will automatically export the following Environment Variables based on your input: $BITRISEIO_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_ALIAS $BITRISEIO_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD $BITRISEIO_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD $BITRISEIO_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_URL Add the Android Sign Step to your Workflow after the Step that builds your APK or AAB file. Bitrise uses the above Environment Variables and sets them as inputs into the respective fields of the  Android Sign  Step. Once the Step runs, it produces either a signed APK or an AAB. The signed APK or AAB is used in deploy Steps, for example, the  Google Play Deploy  Step or the  Deploy to Bitrise.io  Step. The latter deploys the APK\/AAB on the Artifacts  tab. You can also use Ship to deploy your app once you built an APK\/AAB file. Downloading your keystore file You can download your keystore file to the project directory from the ANDROID KEYSTORE FILE section using the  File Downloader  Step: - file-downloader:\n inputs:\n - source: $BITRISEIO_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_URL\n - destination: \"$HOME\/keystores\/my_keystore.jks\" #native android# If a Step requires the keystore file, make sure to include that Step AFTER the File Downloader Step.

There are multiple ways of registering an account: Signing up with emailSigning up with a Git providerGo to your Bitrise Dashboard . Click the + sign on the top menu bar and select Add New App on web UI , which takes you to the Create New App page. Alternatively, you can add your app using a CLI. For more details, check out Adding a new app from a CLI. Choose the account you wish to add the app to. Set the privacy of the app to either Private or Public and click Next . Private vs public apps The most important difference between public and private apps is that if your app is public, everyone who has the build URL can see your build logs: Public apps. With a private app, you have full control over who has any access to the app. Select the Git hosting service that hosts your repository, then find and select your own repository that hosts the project. When prompted to set up repository access, click No, auto-add SSH key . Type the name of the branch that includes your project’s configuration - main , for example, - then click Next . Wait while Bitrise is validating your project. We look for your configuration files and set up your app based on them. Shared schemes only The validation will fail if you do not have a shared scheme in your project. You can still point Bitrise manually to your Xcode scheme but if it’s shared, we automatically detect it for you. Select the export method. You can modify this later - for now, select development . Once you clicked it, you should see your: Project or Workspace path. Scheme name. Export method. macOS stack. Register a webhook when prompted so that Bitrise can start a build automatically when code is pushed to your repository, or a pull request is created. This also kicks off your first build - click the message and it will take you to the build page. " },

Automatic Provisioining The example procedure described here uses manual provisioning, with the Certificate and profile installer Step.

Go to your app’s Workflow Editor, and select the deploy workflow in the WORKFLOW dropdown menu in the top left corner. Check that you have the Certificate and profile installer Step in your Workflow. It must be before the Xcode Archive for Mac Step (you can have other Steps between the two, like Xcode Test for Mac ). Check the Export method input under the app\/pkg export configs input group of the Xcode Archive for Mac Step. If you selected development when you added the app to Bitrise, you don’t need to change the input. Otherwise, manually set it to development . Start a build.

The build stack indicates the virtual machine version that we will use to run your build. The main stack types are: macOS stacks : These stacks run on a macOS operating system and each one includes multiple Xcode versions. Ideal for building iOS apps . They also have Android tools installed if you want to use them to build a cross-platform app. The Android & Docker stack: These stacks run on Linux operating system in a Docker environment. They have all Android tools installed and they are ideal for building native Android apps. Each build runs in its own virtual machine and the virtual machine is rolled back to a saved state, the “base box” state, after the build is finished. This way your builds are always protected by changes made by others and by your previous builds and you can use a stable environment to define your build workflow, since no state persists between builds. Passwordless sudo enabled The user account that is used for the builds is configured to have passwordless sudo enabled. This way you are able to install all the extra things you need for your builds and for other automation. If a tool is not preinstalled on your stack of choice, you can install it yourself - see the guide. After adding your app to Bitrise we will select an appropriate stack for it. You can change the stack at any time on the Stacks & Machines tab of the Workflow Editor. After selecting the stack you want to use, you’ll see a short description of the stack with an additional link to learn more about that specific one (for example, to see what tools are preinstalled, and which versions, on the selected stack). Stack status types Type Description Stable Generally available and expected to be supported for the foreseeable future. Updated when an update for the stack’s primary tool is available. Example: when Xcode 7.3.1 was released, the Xcode 7.3 stack was updated to have 7.3.1 instead of 7.3(.0). Stack prepare types Type Description Pre-booted If a stack is available as pre-booted, and there’s enough pre-booted machines with that stack configuration, your build can start right away, without waiting for the build environment to boot. In case there’s no more available pre-booted machine with that stack configuration, your build will start on an on-demand configuration. On-demand If a stack is available as on-demand configuration and there’s no (available) pre-booted configuration for the stack, our system will have to create a virtual machine for your selected configuration when your build starts. This means that your build will be in preparing environment state while the related virtual machine is created & booted. For a macOS configuration the boot process usually takes about 1 - 1.5 minutes. The prepare time (of course) is not counted into the build time, it won’t affect how long your build can run.

These stacks include multiple Xcode versions to ensure you always have the right Xcode version on demand and to reduce the time spent migrating between stacks when you need to use a different Xcode version. For example, we have a stack for macOS 13 Ventura on M1, which includes Xcode 14.2, Xcode 14.1, and Xcode 14.0. macOS Stable stacks are only updated with Xcode patch versions, Bitrise CLI related updates, dependency manager cache updates and with critical fixes. These stacks are designed so that if a build worked on the stack, the same build should run the same way as long as the stack is available. The Xcode Edge stack is rebuilt regularly. It includes the latest stable release of Xcode, the same pre-installed tools as on the Stable stack, and the dependency manager cache updates. The stack uses the same scripts we use for creating new Xcode stacks. Xcode beta versions Bitrise supports Xcode beta versions. You can check out which specific Xcode versions your stack uses either on the Bitrise System Reports repository or by clicking on the link below the selected stack in the Workflow Editor . Pinning an Xcode version Whenever a new Xcode version comes out, we make sure it's available for our users within two working days. But we do not update existing stable stacks with a new Xcode version as that could potentially break builds: instead, we provide a new stack with the new version, and keep maintaining the older versions. About dependency manager cache updates All of the macOS stacks receive a dependency manager cache update (brew, cocoapods and bitrise CLI) every week. These cache updates do not change the pre-installed tool versions, they only update the package manager caches for faster dependency installs. " },

Available iOS simulators on Bitrise stacks Let's look at an example: Xcode 12.5 has minimum requirements to work with iOS 10.3.1-14.5 simulator runtimes. The 14.5 simulator runtime is the latest version, so we make it available across all stacks. In this case, the 14.5 simulator is compatible with all our currently active Xcode stacks and so it is available on all those stacks. Xcode 13.0 has minimum requirements to work with iOS 10.3.1-15.0 simulator runtimes. The 15.0 simulator runtime is the latest version, so just like for iOS 14.5, we make it available for all compatible stacks, which is all of them except for Xcode 12.5. We continue going through all Xcode versions and taking the latest supported simulator runtime until the last Xcode version, which is Xcode 14.2. When we are done, we also take the most recent version of the iOS simulator runtime prior to the oldest major version. In this case, the oldest major version is iOS 14.5, and the most recent iOS simulator prior to that is iOS 13.7, so that version will also be available for all stacks. This table illustrates which iOS simulator runtimes are available for which Xcode version on our macOS stacks: Available simulator runtimes for iOS (X = available) Simulator Xcode 14.2 Xcode 14.1 Xcode 14.0.1 Xcode 13.4.1 Xcode 13.3.1 Xcode 13.2.1 Xcode 13.1 Xcode 13.0 Xcode 12.5 iOS 16.2 X iOS 16.1 X iOS 16.0 X X X iOS 15.5 X X X X iOS 15.4 X X X X X iOS 15.2 X X X X X X iOS 15.0 X X X X X X X X iOS 14.5 X X X X X X X X X iOS 14.4 iOS 14.3 iOS 14.2 iOS 14.1 iOS 14.0 iOS 13.7 X X X X X X X X X iOS 13.6 iOS 13.5 iOS 13.4 iOS 13.2 iOS 13.1 iOS 13.0 " },

This means, in practice, that there is only ever one active cache on a given branch: it's either an M1-based or an Intel-based cache but never both.

The issue can occur whenever a simulator is launched: for example, our Xcode Test for iOS Step uses an iOS simulator to run tests. Once the simulator starts, your build can hang indefinitely. This doesn't happen every time a simulator is launched so the majority of your builds will be unaffected but the issue can and does happen. The issue has been reported to Apple and a fix coming out with macOS Ventura is being tested. In the meantime, we recommend using a workaround. Detecting and aborting hanging Steps without output If you are experiencing hanging Steps other than the Start Xcode simulator Step, check out our guide on Detecting and aborting hanging Steps without output . The workaround is simple: you launch an Xcode simulator at the start of the build, check whether it hangs and if it does, restart the Workflow so that the hanging issue doesn't waste your time and credits. Add the Start Xcode simulator Step as the very first Step Workflow. It's important to launch the simulator before anything else, even before cloning the repository. If the issue doesn't occur, booting up the simulator should only take a few seconds and you can use it later in the Workflow to run your tests. Add a 90-second boot timeout to the Step. You can do it either in the Workflow Editor or in the bitrise.yml file: Destination device Make sure to also set the simulator destination in the Device destination specifier input of the Step. In the bitrise.yml file, the input's name is destination . You can find the available destination devices in Xcode . On the graphical UI of the Workflow Editor: find the Simulator boot timeout (in seconds) input and set it to 90. In the bitrise.yml , you need to set the wait_for_boot_timeout input to 90: - xcode-start-simulator:\n inputs:\n - destination: platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 8,OS=latest\n - wait_for_boot_timeout: 90 Add the Trigger Bitrise workflow Step to your Workflow right after the Start Xcode simulator Step. We will use this Step to detect whether the previous Step hung and if it did, to restart your build. Set the Step to run even if a previous Step failed. You can do it either in the Workflow Editor or in the bitrise.yml file In the graphical UI of the Workflow Editor: find the Run if previous Step failed toggle and switch it on. In the bitrise.yml file: set the is_always_run attribute to true . - trigger-bitrise-workflow:\n is_always_run: true Set the run_if attribute: the Step should only run if the Start Xcode simulator ended up with a hanged status. The Start Xcode simulator Step exports an Env Var that stores the status of the simulator. This is what we'll use to detect whether the build hung. YAML mode only! You can only do this in the bitrise.yml file of your app. - trigger-bitrise-workflow:\n is_always_run: true\n run_if: '{{enveq \"BITRISE_SIMULATOR_STATUS\" \"hanged\"}}' Configure the API token and the Workflow ID: Build Trigger API token : You can find it on the Code tab of your app's page on Bitrise. Workflow ID : The name of the Workflow that you want to trigger. In this case, it should be the same Workflow. In the bitrise.yml file, the Step should look something like this: - trigger-bitrise-workflow:\n is_always_run: true\n run_if: '{{enveq \"BITRISE_SIMULATOR_STATUS\" \"hanged\"}}'\n inputs:\n - api_token: $TRIGGER_TOKEN\n - workflow_id: my-workflow-name Full YAML example - xcode-start-simulator:\n inputs:\n - destination: platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 8,OS=latest\n - wait_for_boot_timeout: 90\n- trigger-bitrise-workflow:\n is_always_run: true\n run_if: '{{enveq \"BITRISE_SIMULATOR_STATUS\" \"hanged\"}}'\n inputs:\n - api_token: $TRIGGER_TOKEN\n - workflow_id: my-workflow-name That's it. If your build hangs at the simulator stage, it will automatically restart itself within 90 seconds, ensuring that the issue doesn't end up wasting a huge amount of time. " },

"body" : "Bitrise's Android stacks run on Linux-based virtual machines that are created from Docker images. You can find all the image files on GitHub. For our Linux-based stacks, we use standard Docker images, published on Quay , and the related Dockerfile which you can find on GitHub (see below). What is a Dockerfile? A Dockerfile is a file where you describe the docker image \/ environment and is directly used to build a Docker image. Pre-installed tools All stacks have a large number of pre-installed tools available: Preinstalled tools on Bitrise stacksRight now we have four docker images, built on top of each other: Bitrise Base image ( Link ) Image name ID: quay.io\/bitriseio\/bitrise-base-20.04 . Includes all the non-Android tools and environment setup. Ideal to be used for non-Android projects as a base image, if you want to use it locally too, as this is the smallest image. Ruby , Go , Python , git and the bitrise command line tools are all preinstalled and ready to use. OS: Ubuntu 20.04 , 64 bit. Check out the related Dockerfile where you can see what’s preinstalled in this image. Base Android image ( Link ) Image name ID: quay.io\/bitriseio\/android-20.04 . Extends the Bitrise Base image with Android-specific tools and environments. Multiple Android SDK, build tool and system image versions are preinstalled, as well as gradle and maven . You can use the $ANDROID_HOME environment variable to point to the location of the pre-installed Android SDK. Check out the related Dockerfile where you can see what’s preinstalled in this image. Android NDK image ( Link ) Image name ID: quay.io\/bitriseio\/android-ndk-20.04 . Built on the Base Android image and extends it with the latest Android NDK. You can use the $ANDROID_NDK_HOME environment variable to point to the location of the preinstalled Android NDK, and it’s also added to $PATH . Check out the related Dockerfile where you can see what’s preinstalled in this image. Every build runs in a new VM, not just in a new container. The VM is destroyed right after the build. This allows us to grant you full control over Docker and the whole environment. When your build starts on the Docker based Stack, we volume mount the \/var\/run\/docker.sock socket into your container (similar to calling docker run -v \/var\/run\/docker.sock:\/var\/run\/docker.sock ... . You can find a description about this access granting method here ). The docker binary has to be installed inside the base Docker image because docker started to migrate from a single-binary solution to dynamically loaded components, and simply sharing the docker binary is not sufficient anymore. We install Docker in every one of our Docker images so that you don’t have to do anything if you use our image, or you base your own image on our Docker images. This means that you have access to docker in your container, and can use other tools which use docker, like docker-compose . You can, for example, configure and run tests and other automations on website projects using docker-compose . You can call docker info , docker build , docker run , docker login , docker push exactly how you would on your own machine. Shared volumes If you want to run docker in your build and share volumes, please note that only those volumes can be shared that are shared with the base docker container (the one your build is running in). This is due to how docker handles volume sharing. Everything under \/bitrise can be mounted as a volume, but no other path is guaranteed to work with --volume mapping. It means that if you use the standard paths and you use relative paths to mount volumes, it’ll work as expected, as the default source code directory is located inside \/bitrise (by default it’s \/bitrise\/src in our Docker images). What WON’T WORK, however, is if you change the source code directory to be located outside of \/bitrise , or you want to mount a folder with an absolute path outside of \/bitrise . " },

"body" : "You can use Bitrise with a Docker image pulled from Docker Hub, as you can see in our Running docker hello-world example. However, on a free plan for anonymous users, Docker Hub only allows a limited number of image pulls. If you set the image in the Workflow Editor, no authentication will be performed: your pull will be a pull by an anonymous user from a Bitrise public IP address. With many of our users going for this option, the Docker Hub rate limit would mean some users wouldn’t be able to start builds. The workaround is simple: you need to use a Script Step to authenticate yourself with your own Docker Hub account, and use the Step to pull the image from Docker Hub. To do so: Create a personal access token on Docker Hub. This will be used to authenticate you instead of your password. On Bitrise, create two Secret Environment Variables : one for your Docker Hub username and another for the personal access token. In our examples, we’ll use DOCKERHUB_USER for the Docker Hub username and DOCKERHUB_TOKEN . Use the docker login command in a Script Step to authenticate, with the Secret Env Vars as arguments: - script@1.1.3: \n inputs: \n - content: | \n docker login -u $DOCKERHUB_USER -p $DOCKERHUB_TOKEN\n Use the docker run command in the Script Step to run your chosen Docker image. In our example, it’s Docker’s official hello-world image. You can just replace hello-world with any image you want to use from Docker Hub. - script@1.1.3: \n inputs: \n - content: | \n docker login -u $DOCKERHUB_USER -p $DOCKERHUB_TOKEN\n docker run hello-world " },

The --rm flag tells docker to discard the container after the docker run command finishes.

Please note that simply running the command again will not use the same container, but will create a new one! The --privileged flag allows access control of the host from the docker container, so you should never use this flag unless you trust the docker image you will use! This flag is required for allowing VPNs to work (to change network configs of the host), for example.

"body" : "The most frequently asked questions about Bitrise Workspaces: what are they, how to manage its apps, what can members and groups do? What is a Workspace on Bitrise? Workspaces are used to seamlessly manage bigger teams and members inside a company. It is a place to gather all the people working on each of your company’s apps and delegate them through creating different groups. How do I add an app to a Workspace? First, you have to be added to at least one Group of the Workspace. Then, go to the Add new app page and select the Workspace in the dropdown at the top left. You can change this throughout the process of adding the app, or after you finished adding the app, changing the owner is possible through transferring ownership of the app. How do I migrate\/transfer my existing apps to a Workspace? Once you’ve created a Workspace, you can transfer any of your apps to it by going to the Team tab of the app you want to transfer, and clicking the Transfer ownership button at the top right. What are Owners inside a Workspace? Workspaces can have more than one Owner. Owners can manage billing, delete apps and change the billing email, create, delete and assign groups to apps. What can “Members” of a Workspace do? Members are displayed on the People tab of the Workspace’s page. One can be added as a member by including them in a group on the Groups tab. These members have the option to add apps to the Workspace and view a list of all of the Workspace’s apps on the Apps tab. Members can only access a Workspace’s app, if they are granted access to the app directly or through a Group , in respect of their assigned role (Admin, Developer or Tester). What are groups good for? A group is basically a wrapper for members. By creating groups, Owners and Admins can add multiple members to each app’s team at once, making it faster and easier to setup new projects on Bitrise. It also make it faster to reassign, remove and change role of multiple members. Each group is handled as one entity on the app’s Team  tab. They can be added to an app’s team, the group’s role can be set, and by removing the Group from the app’s Team you can revoke the access of every member of that group from the app. It’s not possible however to add or delete individual members of a group there, only on the Workspace’s page. What’s the difference between a Team and a Workspace? Teams are handled per app, Workspaces are handled globally. A Team of a Workspace’s app can contain members invited directly or through the groups assigned to them. Team members with a direct role can only access the app they were invited to and can’t add an app to the Workspace. Members of a Team always have a role assigned to them (Admin, Developer or Tester). Who are the Outside contributors? Outside contributors are members of an app’s Team with a direct role, invited only to an app of a Workspace and not to the Workspace itself. Can I have multiple Workspaces? One user can have as many Workspaces as they like, but each Workspace has to have an active subscription to be able to run builds. Can I remove someone from all of my Workspace’s apps? If you are an Owner of a Workspace, you can remove members and contributors on the Org’s People tab, with one click. Owners can also remove someone from a group on the Groups tab. In this case the user will be removed from all apps’ team that the group is assigned to. How can I leave a Workspace? If you are not the Owner of a Workspace, you can leave a Workplace simply by first accessing the Workspace settings (selecting the gear icon next to the Workplace on the top right of your screen), selecting Team from the menu options on the left, selecting the Members tab, and clicking the \" \" icon next to your email address. I cannot see the Remove from Workspace icon next to my email address If you are an Owner of the Workspace you want to leave, you must first remove yourself from the list of owners in the Owners tab (you must also add a new Owner if there isn't one already).

You can also get in touch with our Support team by clicking the Submit a Request button. In this article we describe how you can enable the Bitrise Support Access so that our Support team can have access to your app , specifically your Workflow , build log, app settings or your bitrise.yml file. With the toggle function, you can easily turn the Bitrise Support Access on and off. No need to add us as a user to your app's Team. The Bitrise Support user, when enabled, has Admin access to your app. That means it can do anything that a regular user with Admin access rights on an app can do: it has access to your builds and can edit your Workflows, modify the inputs of the Team , Code and options in App Settings . No access to billing information The Bitrise Support user can’t see your Account information or any Billing information. Only the owner of the account has access to this information and has the right to modify any account-related records. The Support user can’t see your other apps where the Support user is not enabled. For details, see What the Bitrise Support user can\/can't do? How long does the Bitrise Support Access remain active? Due to security reasons once you toggle the Bitrise Support Access on, it will remain active for two weeks after which it automatically gets revoked. Let’s see how to set it up! Admin access only Only users with the role of admin on the app's team can access all functions of the App Settings page of an app. Open your app on Bitrise. On the main page of the app, click on the App Settings icon: . On the left, select General from the menu options. Scroll down to the Support Access and toggle the switch to the right to enable it. It might take a couple of seconds to work and you might need to refresh your page to see the enabled status. In case of a failing Workflow, our best practice is to create a new and correct version of the failing Workflow called support-testing . You can compare our support-testing with your own and update yours or keep the support-testing orkflow, rename it as you wish, and develop it further. " },

"body" : "Bitrise needs access to all repositories or submodules for a successful build, so if your app has submodules or private repo dependencies, you must grant Bitrise access to those as well. If you have a project with one or more submodules or other private repository dependencies (for example, CocoaPods repositories), Bitrise needs access to all repositories or submodules for a successful build. Bitrise uses SSH to access Git repositories of private apps : to grant access, you need to make sure all the repositories can be accessed with the public SSH key generated for your Bitrise app. App privacy The scope of this guide mainly covers private Bitrise apps. The Git cloning submodules and repository dependencies section briefly covers how to access multiple repositories with a public app : the process is much simpler and all you need is to make sure that all repositories have an HTTPS git clone URL. You don’t need to worry about SSH keys with public apps, as they cannot have them. There are two ways to achieve this: Register the same SSH key for every repository you have to access during the build. Register the SSH key with a bot user and add that user to all repositories. Registering the same SSH key for every repository is the best, most secure way - but not all services support it. GitLab and Bitbucket does support it, GitHub, however, doesn’t. If your code is stored on GitHub, read on! We’ll go through the other option, using a bot user or machine user - GitHub calls them machine users - in detail. In brief, the concept is simple: you register the Bitrise public SSH key to a user and add that user to all repositories that have to be accessed for your Bitrise build. Machine user with read only access It is not required to use a special bot\/machine user: you can add the SSH key to your own account on the git hosting service. The best practice, however, is to use a machine user, with read only access, for those repositories you want to access during the build. GitHub recommends this method for accessing multiple repositories. Let’s quickly go through an example. The MultiBit app We have a Bitrise app we’ll call MultiBit. It has a main repository and it needs to pull additional data from two other, private repositories during a Bitrise build. Our main user is called BitMan and his GitHub account is linked to his Bitrise account. To access the private repositories during the build, BitMan creates another user on GitHub, called BitBot. BitBot will be the machine user. Now, BitMan accesses the App Settings page of his Bitrise app, and copies the public SSH key from the Current SSH public key field. BitMan then adds the SSH key to the BitBot user on GitHub and adds BitBot to the two private repositories as a collaborator. Now BitBot has the Bitrise public key and has access to the private repositories as necessary. It’s time to test if BitMan’s setup works. BitMan goes to Bitrise and opens the Workflow Editor . He has the Activate SSH Key Step in his repository so the SSH key will work. BitMan adds a Script Step to clone the private repositories - as the Git Clone Step only works with the main repository! Once all that is done, the build should work as expected. " },

"body" : "You have two options when it comes to accessing multiple repositories during a Bitrise build: Cloning all the repositories on the virtual machine, and accessing them as needed. Adding the additional repositories as submodules to your main repository. In the latter case, you do not need to worry about cloning them: if you set up SSH access correctly, the Git Clone Step will take care of everything. If you don’t want to or can’t add your repository dependencies as submodules, read on: we’ll talk about how to clone them. Public vs private apps There is one important detail to keep in mind when you want to give access to all submodules or private repository dependencies for an app: the app’s privacy settings determine what git URL should you use . If you have a private app: use SSH URLs everywhere! Most services support SSH key based authentication only for SSH URLs (for example, git@github.com:bitrise-io\/bitrise.git ). Therefore every private repository you want to use have to be addressed with the SSH URL. If you have direct private git repo references in your CocoaPods Podfile, you’ll have to use the SSH URL there as well. The same applies for submodules and every other private git repository URL you want to use with the SSH key you register on bitrise.io . If you have a public app: use HTTPS URLs everywhere! SSH URLs require SSH keys even if the repository is public. For security reasons, public apps CANNOT have SSH keys. As HTTPS git clone URLs do not require any authentication in the case of public repositories, they should be used for public Bitrise apps. The Git Clone Step The Git Clone Step only works with the main repository. If you need to access multiple private repositories, do not add multiple Git Clone Steps. Use Script Steps to clone those repositories on the Bitrise virtual machine. To clone additional private repositories during the build: Make sure you added a user with the Bitrise public SSH key to all the repositories. Make sure you have the Activate SSH Key Step and the Git Clone Step at the start of your Workflow. Add one or more Script Steps to clone the additional private repositories to the build. Run a build. Cloning issues If you encounter issues with git cloning - for example, not all submodules are cloned - try the following command after cloning: git submodule update –recursive –remote –merge –force " },

If your Bitrise app is public, anyone who has the build URL can see the build logs. Open source projects are great - we all love them! They can be a pain to maintain, however, especially with CI\/CD in the picture. That’s why we have introduced the Public Apps feature for Bitrise: to make everyone’s life a lot easier! If your Bitrise app is public, anyone who has the build URL can see the build logs. For example, if the CI status check on GitHub fails on a pull request, anyone can click on the build URL and view the build logs. To create a public app, simply add a new app to Bitrise and at the start of the process, set the privacy of the app to Public . Can't modify privacy later You can't change this setting later! Once you've added an app as a public app, you can't set it back to private. You would have to add the app again. When you have a public app, outside contributors can troubleshoot issues easier, find out why, for example, a pull request of theirs resulted in a failed build. They do not have to be invited to a Bitrise team to be able to view Bitrise logs and they do not need the help of a Bitrise team member, either. Of course, this does not mean anyone can do anything with your public app on Bitrise. If the user viewing the logs is not invited to work on the app in some role, they will only be able to: View the build logs. Download the build logs. View the build’s bitrise.yml file.

"body" : "On the graphical UI of the Workflow Editor, you can choose between locking a Step to either a major version or a minor version in any of your Workflows. This determines what version of the Step your Workflow will use. Locking a Step to a version means that your Workflow is automatically updated to use the latest release of the Step’s selected version type, either major or minor, but it won’t get updated if a different major or minor version is released. If a Step is locked to a major version, it is automatically updated if a new minor version or a new patch for that major version is released. If a new major version is released, it won’t be updated. If a Step is locked to a minor version, it is automatically updated only if a new patch for that minor version is released. If a new minor or major version is released, it won’t be updated. Version locking The Example Step’s current version in the Workflow is 2.3.3. A new minor version comes out: 2.4.0. If the Step is locked to major version 2.x.x, the Step is updated to 2.4.0. If the Step is locked to minor version 2.3.x, the Step is NOT updated to 2.4.0. Now let’s say the Example Step gets a new major version: 3.0.0! In that case, the Step will not be automatically updated either way. If you want to use the new version, you need to lock the Step to either major version 3.x.x or minor version 3.0.x. This way you can be sure that a new update will not break your builds. To lock a Step to a major or minor version: Open your app on Bitrise . Click the Workflows button on the main page.

"body" : "Sometimes the conditions required to determine whether a Step should run or not are complex and multi-layered. If so, using a complex chain of Go templates in a run_if expression can be overwhelming, especially if you prefer other languages instead of Go. In such cases, we recommend using a workaround: add a Script Step in your Workflow, and write a script that evaluates to a certain value. Store that value in an Environment Variable, and then the Step with the conditional expression only needs to check that value. Using a non-Go script for a run_if expression In this example, we'll create a simple Bash script and store its value, then check whether it matches a preset value. First, we add a Script Step, and in the script content, we define a value. Once the value is defined, we use envman to store it in an Environment Variable. In this particular case, we define a variable in Bash, and use that variable as the value for our Env Var: workflows: \n example: \n steps: \n - script@1:\n title: Do anything with Script step \n inputs: \n - content: |- \n #!\/usr\/bin\/env bash\n # fail if any commands fails \n set -e\n # debug log\n set -x\n # creating the variable and storing it as an Env Var \n my_variable='This is the value we need!' \n envman add --key OUR_CONDITION --value \"$my_variable\"\n We then create a simple run_if expression for the Step for which we need a condition. In this case, our Step is the Save cache Step, and we'll check if the value of the OUR_CONDITION variable matches the value stored in the previous Bash variable: - save-cache@1: \n run_if: |- \n {{getenv \"OUR_CONDITION\" | eq \"This is the value we need!\"}} Since the values match, the Save cache Step will run.

Ensure that your builds do not exceed the time limit by setting up Step timeout for Steps that might cause builds to hang. A Step timeout, defined in seconds, sets a maximum time a Step is allowed to run. If the Step exceeds that limit, the Workflow moves on to the next Step. This is useful if, for example, your builds hang for not immediately obvious reasons - you can set timeouts for the Step or Steps which are suspected to have caused the problem. Find the Step in the bitrise.yml file. You can edit the file locally, or on the bitrise.yml tab of the Workflow Editor. Add a timeout property before the other Step inputs and specify its value in seconds: - xcode-test@1.18.14:\n timeout: 120\n inputs:\n - project_path: \"$BITRISE_PROJECT_PATH\"\n - scheme: \"$BITRISE_SCHEME\" " },

We recommend setting it to 600 seconds (10 minutes). Aborting a hanging build automatically Compared to setting a time limit for Steps , the No Output Timeout function only aborts a build no output log is generated for a set amount of time. Any log output will reset the timeout. This can result in a Step running longer than the value you set in BITRISE_NO_OUTPUT_TIMEOUT . Click Save . You can check the Build log of your build to determine if the function is enabled. And that's it!

Disabling the No Output Timeout function for a specific Step If you enabled the No Output Timeout function globally and want to disable it for specific Steps, you can add the no_output_timeout: 0 Step property just above the  inputs:  part of the chosen Step(s) in the bitrise.yml .

Duplicate Steps Before deciding to develop a new Step, please make sure that there’s no already existing Step that performs the same function. You can search for Steps on our Integrations page or in the Step Library on GitHub. A Step is a build task: for example, the Git Clone Step clones your Git repository at the start of a build while the Google Play Deploy Step can deploy your finished app to the Play Store. A Step contains the code that performs the build task. You can configure the inputs and parameters that define the task, and view and reuse the outputs a Step generates. Reusing the output means that another Step can use it as the value of one of its inputs. Our Steps are written in Go or Bash. Steps are contained in their own Git repositories: that includes the code and the step.yml file that defines the configuration of the Step. If you wish to make the Step available to other users, the step.yml file needs to be included in the bitrise-steplib repository so that other users can find the Step on our website, in the Workflow Editor . Sharing Steps Sharing your custom Steps is optional: a Step with a use case that is specific to a single user will not be much help to others. As you can run a Step from your own machine or from any Git repository, your custom Steps do not have to be part of the Bitrise Step Library.

Note that you can change any of these before submitting your Step to Bitrise for review: the data will be included in the generated step.yml file that you can edit at your leisure later. During the initial Step creation process, you can use placeholders if you want to. Open a command line interface, such as the Terminal app on MacOS. Create a new directory for your Step if you haven’t done so yet and enter that directory: Create the Step with the Bitrise Step plugin: When prompted, set the name of the Step’s author. Hit Enter to leave it on the default value. When prompted, set the Step’s name. The plugin automatically generates a Step ID based on this name. Provide a summary: no more than a couple of sentences about what the Step does. Provide a description of the Step. This should contain configuration information and troubleshooting information for the Step. Select the primary category of the Step. To do so, type the number of the preferred option and hit Enter. This can be changed later. Choose the toolkit you want to use: you can choose either Go or Bash. Set up the source code hosting data for the Step: To do so, first decide if you want to host it on GitHub or on any other site and enter the appropriate option: If you chose GitHub, you will be asked to provide the username of the account that will own the repository. If you chose not to store it on GitHub, you have to provide a valid URL for the repository. You are done!

There is no need to add domain-specific prefixes to the input keys, as inputs are only exposed for the Step run process.

Step input values are strings: the Bitrise CLI exposes the Step inputs as Environment Variables to the Steps. Provide default values for Step inputs if possible (and if it makes sense). That makes the Step configuration easier for Bitrise users. Environment Variables must not be used as default values, unless: They are exposed by the Bitrise CLI or by bitrise.io . They are generated as an output by another Step (for example, $BITRISE_IPA_PATH , $BITRISE_AAB_PATH ). This is because the Workflow Editor highlights required inputs without values to express the Step will not work without setting a valid value for the given input. If you set an Env Var, which does not have an automatically assigned value, as the default value for an input, the Workflow Editor will think the required input in question has a valid value set (even if the default Env Var has no value yet).

Under opts, provide a title, a summary, and a description option. Let’s take a look at how these should look like! Description and summary Both description and summary accept Markdown formatting in its values. title : It should be a short and descriptive sentence or half sentence: The Xcode project’s path. It should not be a CLI flag or API parameter name used internally. This makes Step configuration easier, as no preexisting knowledge will be required about the underlying tool or service interfaces. It’s also easier to change the Step’s implementation while maintaining backwards compatibility. summary : It is the short version of the description, which provides a quick overview of the input. On the Bitrise Workflow Editor, the summary of the inputs is presented by default when you click on a Step. description : It is the user facing description of the Step input: this should provide a deeper, more detailed explanation of the input. By default, it is not visible in the Workflow Editor, unless the user clicks on the input in question. Here is an example: - install_defaults: \"yes\"\n opts:\n description: Installs default (Bitrise) Wildcard Provisioning Profile and\n Certificate files for testing.\n summary: Installs default (Bitrise) Wildcard code signing files.\n title: Installs default code signing files Now, let’s talk about some other configuration options for Steps.

However, if the is_always_run property is set to true , the Step runs regardless of the status of previous Steps in the Workflow. This can be very useful, for example, in the case of Steps that can send notifications about the build: they can send notifications about failed builds. is_skippable : As mentioned above, Steps do not run if a previous Step in the Workflow failed. However, if a Step’s is_skippable property is set to true , the build will not fail and subsequent Steps will run even if that particular Step fails. A good example is the Cache:Pull Step: if an app has no build cache to pull from, the Step will fail but that is no reason to fail the build. run_if : If you want to make Step execution dependent on a certain condition, use the run_if property to define the run condition.

"body" : "A Bitrise project scanner must have a scan result model. Every platform scanner writes its possible options, configurations, and warnings into this model. These will be translated into Step input values by choosing the desired values for the given options. The project scanner is a tool that identifies the given project’s type and generates a basic Bitrise configuration. Each supported project type has its own scanner: these scanners are stored as separate packages. A project type scanner defines at least two Workflows : one for testing ( primary ) and one for building ( deploy ). It includes the minimal amount of Steps to successfully run them . Build and test Steps Build Steps and test Steps have specific requirements: A build  Step must build your app so that it is ready for deployment and it must output an Environment Variable that points to the output file(s). For example, a build Step to build an iOS app must output an .ipa file (not, say, .xcodearchive ) and the path to this .ipa file. A test Step must output the test results so that they are available for viewing on the build page on bitrise.io. When adding a new project on the website or initializing a project on your own machine, the bitrise-init tool iterates through every scanner, calls the scanner interface methods on each of them and collects their outputs. Based on these outputs, a basic configuration is generated. The possible Workflows are described in a scan result model. The model consists of: options configs warnings Here is the basic structure of the model, in YAML: options:\n DETECTED_PLATFORM_1: OptionModel\n DETECTED_PLATFORM_2: OptionModel\n ...\n\nconfigs:\n DETECTED_PLATFORM_1:\n CONFIG_NAME_1: ConfigModel\n CONFIG_NAME_2: ConfigModel\n ...\n DETECTED_PLATFORM_2:\n CONFIG_NAME_1: ConfigModel\n CONFIG_NAME_2: ConfigModel\n ...\n ...\n\nwarnings:\n DETECTED_PLATFORM_1:\n - \"warning message 1\"\n - \"warning message 2\"\n ...\n DETECTED_PLATFORM_2:\n - \"warning message 1\"\n - \"warning message 2\"\n ...

"body" : "Options represents a question and the possible answers to the question. For example: Question: What is the path to the iOS project files? Possible answers: List of possible paths to check These questions and answers are translated into Step inputs. The scanner should either determine the input value or let the user select or type the value. For example, the Xcode Archive & Export for iOS Step has an input called export-method . This informs the Step of the type of .ipa you want to export. The value cannot be determined based on the source code so the scanner collects every possible value and presents them to the user in the form of a list to choose from. Selecting an option can start a chain: it can lead to different options being presented afterwards. For example, if you select an Xcode scheme that has associated test targets, it leads to different “questions”. Similarly, selecting a certain option can lead to a different workflow being generated afterwards. " },

"body" : "No matter what Android or Gradle Step you use in your Bitrise Workflow, there is an option to define additional command line arguments for Gradle. Add  --profile  to the relevant input variable to generate a performance report of the Gradle tasks. In the example below, we are adding the argument to the Android Unit Test Step. Add the Android Unit Test Step to your Workflow and set the necessary input variables: Project location : $PROJECT_LOCATION . Module : $MODULE . Variant : $VARIANT . Arguments : --profile2 . Add a Script Step to the end of the Workflow to compress the report files and copy the ZIP file to the deploy directory: #!\/usr\/bin\/env bash\n# fail if any commands fails\nset -e\n# debug log\nset -x\n\nzip -r $BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR\/gradle-profile.zip $PROJECT_LOCATION\/build\/reports\/profile Gradle creates the HTML report in build\/reports\/profile\/ , so we need to take all files in that folder (HTML, CSS and JS files), compress them, and move the ZIP archive to $BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR . Files in this folder can be accessed on the build page’s Artifacts tab. Trigger a manual build of your app. Download and unarchive the gradle-profile.zip file, then open the HTML report in your browser. Go to the Artifacts tab and check the various aspects of the build in the report: The  Summary  tab shows time spent on things other than task execution. The  Task execution  tab lists all tasks sorted by execution time. Cached tasks are marked as  UP-TO-DATE . This helps to fine-tune the  Bitrise Cache Steps  by comparing the reports of multiple builds. For Gradle optimization ideas, check out this article by Google . If you only want to display task execution times only in the build log, you can use the  build-time-tracker  plugin. " },

"body" : "A Bitrise build is specified by the app’s Workflow which is a collection of Steps. The app’s build configuration can be modified in the bitrise.yml file or in the graphical Workflow Editor. A Bitrise build is a series of jobs, specified by the app’s Workflow which is a collection of Steps . The app’s build configuration is specified in the bitrise.yml configuration file which you can modify in bitrise.io ’s graphical Workflow Editor or locally. The file can be stored on bitrise.io or in your app's Git repository . When a build is running, the scripts that define the Steps will be executed in the order you’ve defined in your Workflow, with the input parameters you set. They can produce multiple different outputs that other Steps can use, including but not limited to executable binaries, screenshots, test reports, variables, and so on. The build process is the following: Starting the build , either manually or by an automatic trigger. Environment preparation: A virtual machine will be provisioned and prepared to run the build. Build specific Environment Variables are preset so you can use these in your Steps. You can find more information about the available stacks in the Workflow Editor, on the Stack tab. Workflow execution: Steps in Workflows are executed in the same order as defined in the Workflow Editor of your application, from top to bottom. You can reorder the Steps by dragging them around. The log each Step generates will be displayed on the build’s details page. Cleanup: After the execution of the build, a build log is created and stored on the Bitrise server. The virtual machine running the build is destroyed so your code\/files will never fall into the wrong hands. Build retention for 200 days On the Builds page of your app, we only show builds from the last 200 days. The same limit applies if you are searching for specific builds on the page. This limitation also applies to most API calls: the GET\/apps\/{app-slug}\/builds endpoint and related endpoints can only return builds from the last 200 days. However, there are two methods to get a build that is older than 200 days: If you know the exact build URL, you can access the build. You can use the GET\/apps\/{app-slug}\/archived-builds API endpoint: Listing the archived builds of an app. After the build has finished, users can be notified via email , or you can set up your own Slack integration , for example. A Bitrise Pipeline is the top level of our CI\/CD configuration. Pipelines can be used to organize the entire CI\/CD process and to set up advanced configurations with multiple different tasks running parallel and\/or sequentially.

In a Pipeline configuration, you need to specify the Pipeline that should be triggered by certain code events, such as pushes, pull requests and tags.

"body" : "Privately hosted repositories Unfortunately, this feature is not yet supported for users who can't use the service credential user integration; for example, if the repository is is only accessible under a private IP subnet. There's a workaround, however: Storing the bitrise.yml in a privately hosted repository . This workaround works, for example, for GitHub Enterprise and Bitbucket Server users. When you store the bitrise.yml configuration file in your repository, the build process on Bitrise will use that file to run your builds. This means that: You have full control over versioning your configuration file. Every time you make a change to your Workflows or your trigger map, you must commit the changes to the file in the repository. You don’t need to create your own bitrise.yml file in advance: you can use the file stored on bitrise.io . Let's see how to store the bitrise.yml file in a repository that does not contain one yet. Multiple apps with the same repository You can only store a single bitrise.yml file in a given repository. Bitrise will look for the file in the root directory, and as such, currently there’s no way to include two in separate folders. If you have two or more Bitrise apps connected to the same repository, you can store all their Workflows in the same bitrise.yml file. Of course each Workflow must have a different name: you can’t have two primary Workflows in the same file, for example. Open the app on Bitrise and go to the Team tab. Check the Service credential user section. The service credential user must be a Bitrise user who has at least read access to the repository. Service credential integration Be aware that if your app uses a repository where the Service credential user integration is not supported - for example, the repository is only accessible under a private IP subnet -, the feature won’t work as the website can’t grab the bitrise.yml due to IP addressing limitations. Go to the Workflow tab. In the Workflow Editor, go to the bitrise.yml tab. Click Store in app repository . When prompted to add the bitrise.yml to your app's repository, you have two options: Copy the content of the current bitrise.yml file to the clipboard. You can then create your own file and copy the contents into it. Download the current bitrise.yml file. In your repository, commit the bitrise.yml file to the root of the default branch. Branches of the repository The default branch of your app must always have a bitrise.yml file on it. You can store different bitrise.yml files on the other branches: Storing a bitrise.yml file on multiple branches in the repository. You can check your Bitrise app's default branch on bitrise.io by going to the Settings tab and finding the DEFAULT BRANCH option. On Bitrise, click Update setting . When prompted to make sure your bitrise.yml file is valid, click Continue . Make sure the file is valid The bitrise.yml file in your repository always must be valid! If it contains incorrect syntax, it can break your builds. If all goes well, you should receive confirmation of successfully changing your bitrise.yml storage settings. Allowlist the Bitrise website IP addresses If you use some form of self-hosted solution for storing your code, you might need to allowlist the static IP addresses of the Bitrise website and its background workers. This allows you to use such features as storing the bitrise.yml file in your own repository, or receiving build status updates from Bitrise: IP addresses for the Bitrise website. " },

The Selective builds setting provides change detection for your builds. Enabling it allows you to only trigger a build of an app if certain files or folders have been modified. You may want to use this setting if: You have a monorepo; that is, you build multiple apps from a single repository. Multiple apps share common files in your repository. Selective Builds with non-Github projects The current version of our Selective Builds feature only works with GitHub projects. If your repository is hosted by another Git hosting service, the option will not be available. Using the Selective builds feature Let's say you want to make sure that a commit to your app's repository triggers a Bitrise build only if the mycode.go file on the develop branch is modified in the commit. In this example, you have a branch called  develop . You have a trigger that starts a build every time a code push happens on the  develop  branch. In the selective builds feature, you specified the  mycode.go  file in the input field. If you make a commit on the develop branch that modifies the mycode.go file, Bitrise will trigger a build. If your commit doesn't modify the file in any way, Bitrise will not trigger a build. To configure selective builds: Admin access only Only users with the role of admin on the app's team can access all functions of the App Settings page of an app. Open your app on Bitrise. On the main page of the app, click on the App Settings icon: . Make sure the appropriate service credential user is set on the Integrations page. This user must have admin right for the GitHub repository of the project. Click on your app on your Dashboard . On the left, select Builds . Find the Selective builds section. Click the Add path button. Can't find the button? If you can't find the button - like in the screenshot above -, it is because of two possible reasons: The app's repository isn't hosted on GitHub. The service credential user isn't set correctly or doesn't have admin rights to the repo. In the pop-up window, set the paths you need. You can add one path at a time. " },

You can cancel running builds or builds on hold - no need to abort them manually! If you turn on the Rolling Builds feature, the previous builds of your app can be automatically aborted once a new one is started. Please note that manual and scheduled builds are also cancelled if you start a new build with the Rolling builds option enabled. When is a build aborted? If you trigger a build on a branch where a build is already running, the running build is aborted only if it runs the same Workflow . For example, if you trigger a build on the master branch of your repository with the deploy Workflow, it will NOT cancel a build running on the same master branch with the primary Workflow. You can also set which types of triggered builds you wish to abort. Let’s see how! Admin access only Only users with the role of admin on the app's team can access all functions of the App Settings page of an app. Open your app on Bitrise. On the main page of the app, click on the App Settings icon: . On the left, select Builds . Find the Rolling builds section.

You can configure automatic build triggers on Bitrise by specifying a code event that should trigger a build and a destination Workflow that should run.

There are three types of triggers: Code push: code push to the specified branch of the app's repository triggers a build. Pull request: specify source and\/or destination branches where any pull request will trigger a build. Git tag: a commit with a specific tag triggers a build.

This means that you can’t have an item which only specifies the workflow , at least one filter ( push_branch \/ pull_request_source_branch \/ pull_request_target_branch \/ tag ) has to be specified! The available filters: push_branch : A filter which is matched against code push events’ branch parameter. pull_request_source_branch : A filter which is matched against Pull Request events’ source branch parameter (the branch the pull request was started from). pull_request_target_branch : A filter which is matched against Pull Request events’ target branch parameter - the branch the pull request will be merged into. tag : A filter which is matched against Tag Push events’ tag (name) parameter. pattern : DEPRECATED - this filter was used for both code push and pull request events, in combination with is_pull_request_allowed . This filter is now deprecated, as the new filters allow better control over event mapping. One trigger = one build One trigger can only select a single Workflow \/ can only start a single build. The first item which matches the trigger will select the Workflow for the build! The order of the items also matters: trigger_map:\n- push_branch: \"*\"\n push_branch: \"master*\"\n workflow: primary By specifying a push_branch: master item after a push_branch: \"*\" item, the push_branch: master would never be selected as every code push event would match push_branch: \"*\" first, and the first item which matches the trigger will select the Workflow for the build! If you define multiple filters in a single item then all filters have to match in order to select that item’s workflow. For example: trigger_map:\n- pull_request_target_branch: \"master\"\n pull_request_source_branch: \"develop\"\n workflow: primary This will only select the primary workflow if the pull request’s source branch is develop AND the target branch is master . If you want to specify filters which should be treated separately, for example, to select primary for pull requests where the source is develop , as well as select for the ones which target master : trigger_map:\n- pull_request_target_branch: \"master\"\n workflow: primary\n- pull_request_source_branch: \"develop\"\n workflow: primary Can't mix filters in the same item You can’t mix and match push_branch , tag and the pull_request filters in the same item. This would effectively mean that the workflow should be selected if the event is a code push and a pull request (or tag push) event at the same time. This is simply not possible, source code hosting services send separate webhooks for pull request (pre-merge state), tags and for code push events. A single webhook event will never be code push, tag push and pull request at the same time, a single webhook is always related to only one type (code push, tag push or pull request). " },

"body" : "You can start multiple parallel builds by using the Bitrise Start for Build and the Bitrise Wait for Build Steps. Using Build Pipelines to start parallel builds with a single trigger If you have a credit-based account and you are planning on running multiple tasks parallel with a single trigger, we recommend using Build Pipelines. For more information, check out Build Pipelines . If you have more than one concurrency or you have a credit-based account, you can run more than one build simultaneously. And since we want to make life as easy for you as possible, these builds can be started automatically, with a single trigger. Let’s go through how it works! In the example, we have three Workflows of a single app set up to run at the same time. Let’s call these Workflows Trigger , Building and Testing . The workflow called Trigger will be triggered by a pull request, and then the workflow will trigger Building and Testing which will run simultaneously. All workflows run on separate, clean Virtual Machines. They can also run on different types of stacks: to choose the stack for any Workflow, go to the Workflow Editor of the app and select the Stack tab. If any of the builds fail, the build will be considered a failed build. If the build is triggered by a webhook, Bitrise will send a summarized build result to your Git provider. If any of the parallel builds fail, a failed status will be reported. No reports for \"child\" builds Bitrise will send a Git status report only for the original \"parent\" build, the one that triggered all the other builds. The \"child\" builds will not send back status reports to your Git provider! For example, if build A triggers builds B and C, a status report will be sent once A is finished. There will be no separate status reports for builds B and C, however. What you need: A Personal Access Token. A Secret Environment Variable storing the token. The Bitrise Start Build Step. The Bitrise Wait for Build Step. Bitrise Start Build Step on the CI Since the Bitrise Build Start Step heavily relies on the parameters of the currently running build (for example, the app slug, build slug and the build number) to call the API, you cannot use the Bitrise Build Start Step locally. bitrise.yml example You can edit your bitrise.yml file on the bitrise.yml tab of the Workflow Editor, or you can edit the file locally. The example below focuses on the Bitrise UI, but if you prefer to use YAML format, check out our example ! Create a Personal Access Token for your user. Go to Profile Settings and select the Security option on the left side. Click the Generate new button. Copying the token Make sure the copy the token once it's generated: you won't be able to see it again! Create a Secret Environment Variable on the Secrets tab of the app’s Workflow Editor and add the token as its value. Feel free to use any key you wish for the secret. We recommend something simple like $ACCESS_TOKEN . Add the Bitrise Start Build Step to the Trigger Workflow. Note that the Bitrise Start Build Step will set an Environment Variable to all builds it starts: $SOURCE_BITRISE_BUILD_NUMBER . Each build triggered by the Step will have their own build numbers but the source build number will be the same for all of them. Add the secret env storing your personal access token to the Bitrise Access Token input of the Step: click the Select secret variable button and choose the key you created. Find the Workflows input of the Step, and add Building and Testing to it. Add the Bitrise Wait for Build Step as the last Step of the Trigger Workflow. Checking build statuses The Step checks statuses of the builds defined in the Step. The builds are defined in the Build slugs input: the slugs are the output of the Bitrise Start Build Step. As long as the builds defined by the slugs are running, the Step will hold the build it is running in. The build will fail if any of the builds included in the Step fail. Add the secret env storing your personal access token to the Bitrise Access Token input of the Step: click the Select secret variable button and choose the key you created. And you are done! Once you trigger the Trigger workflow, the Bitrise Start Build Step of the Workflow will trigger two more builds running simultaneously. If those two builds are successful, the Bitrise Wait for Build Step lets the first build finish. A single status report is sent to the git hosting provider, regardless whether the build is successful or not. Webhooks Starting builds manually Triggering builds automatically " },

"body" : "You might not want to update a cache archive every time you run a build. By skipping caching, you can: Avoid saving potentially incorrect build data in the cache. Make the PR validation workflow faster. Limit the amount of data stored and transferred. If the cached content did not change during your build at all, the Save cache Step can automatically skip compressing and uploading the cache. To make this work, you need to make sure your cache archive has a unique cache key that changes whenever the contents of the cache change: in practice, this requires a dynamic key with a checksum and a file that describes the cached content. The checksum will be calculated based on the contents of the file; if the file remains unchanged, so does the checksum. We strongly recommend configuring the Step in a way to take advantage of this feature. Follow the steps below, or skip ahead to our YAML example . Skipping the Save cache Step entirely If you don't wish to update the cache archive even if the content that would be cached has changed, you can either remove the Save cache Step from your Workflow or you can set conditions for the Step: Enabling or disabling a Step conditionally. Open your app on Bitrise . Click the Workflows button on the main page. Open your Workflow and select the Save cache Step. Set the Unique cache key input to true . If the input is set to false , the Step can still skip uploading the cache but it will need to create the cache archive first to calculate its checksum. This takes time. In the Cache key input, create a key with a checksum for a file that describes the cached content. For example, npm-cache-{{ checksum \"package-lock.json\" }} is a dynamic key that remains unchanged as long as the package-lock.json file does not change. Add the same dynamic key to the Cache keys input of the Restore cache Step. If everything is configured correctly, if the keys in the two caching Steps match, the cache archive will not be updated. YAML example for using a dynamic key with checksum In this example, the cache key calculates the sum for any .gradle file and the gradle.properties file. Both the Restore cache and the Save cache Step looks for the same cache key: workflows: \n caching: \n steps: \n - restore-cache@1: \n inputs: \n - key: gradle-cache-{{ checksum \"**\/*.gradle*\" \"gradle.properties\" }} \n - save-cache@1: \n inputs: \n - key: gradle-cache-{{ checksum \"**\/*.gradle*\" \"gradle.properties\" }} \n - is_key_unique: 'true' " },

Branch-based caching vs key-based caching This guide is is about legacy, branch-based caching. For key-based caching, check out our in-depth guide: Key-based caching. You can read about our dedicated key-based caching Steps here: Dedicated caching Steps for dependency managers. The basics of using the cache in your builds are simple and it can work out of the box, depending on your Workflows: you just have to use the two dedicated Steps. Add the Bitrise.io Cache:Pull Step right before you need the cache. For example, in the case of an iOS app, you can insert the Bitrise.io Cache:Pull Step between the Git Clone Repository and the dependency installer Steps (such as the Run CocoaPods install or the Carthage Steps). You should not put the Bitrise.io Cache:Pull Step BEFORE the Git Clone Repository Step. Build cache expiry The build cache, related to a specific branch, expires after seven days which means it is automatically deleted - but only if there’s no new build on that branch in the meantime. This means that if you do builds on a specific branch more frequently than a week, the cache won’t get deleted. If you don’t start a build on that specific branch for more than seven days, then the related cache will be deleted, and and your next build will run like the first. Add the Bitrise.io Cache:Push Step as the last Step of the Workflow. For simple use cases, that’s it, that’s all you have to do. These Steps work out of the box alongside Steps with their own caching function. But if you wish to learn more and create your own caching configuration, read on! Pull request builds By default, if you run a build that is triggered by a pull request, the Bitrise.io Cache:Push Step won’t work: in this case, a pull request build can only read the build cache but can’t update it! We strongly recommend that you do not change this! From a security perspective, the best practice is to never allow pull request builds to alter anything that can affect other Bitrise builds. If you absolutely must change it, you need to use a run_if expression in the app’s bitrise.yml file. Read more about run_if expressions: Enabling or disabling a Step conditionally.

"body" : "You can also tell the Bitrise.io Cache:Push Step to specifically ignore certain content. Ignoring means one of two things: A file or folder isn’t checked for changes: if the specified path is included in the previous cache archive, it will be included in the new one with the same content as before. A file or folder is completely excluded: in other words, it isn’t uploaded to the cache at all, regardless of its changes. You can choose either option for any of your files or folders. To ignore certain files or folders: In your Workflow, open the Bitrise.io Cache:Push Step. Find the Ignore Paths from change check input. Add the path or paths for files and folders that you want to ignore. You can use either an absolute path, or a path relative to the root of your repository. If you want to completely exclude a given path from the cache archive, prefix the path with ! . For example, !my\/path\/ . If you want to exclude a given path from change checking, just add the path without any prefix. If a path is located inside an ignored cache path item and the path is NOT prefixed with an ! , the path will be included in the cache archive, but it will not be checked for changes. For example, if you add my\/path\/ to the input, the path directory will be included in the archive but it will not be checked for changes. You can, of course, specify certain patterns in the paths, too. For example: Replacing a path element with * : a\/*\/b : this will match a\/x\/b Replacing a part of the path with ** : a\/**\/b will match a\/x\/y\/z\/b Ignoring an entire directory with \/ . For example, \/my\/full\/path\/ ignores everything in the path folder. Ignoring paths You can’t ignore a path which results in an invalid cache item. For example, if you specify a\/path\/to\/cache path to be cached, you can’t ignore a\/path\/to , as that would ignore every file and wouldn’t check for changes, hence no fingerprint could be generated for a\/path\/to\/cache . This won’t fail the Step: you’ll simply receive the following warning: No path to cache, skip caching... You can, however, ignore paths inside a cache path. For example, if your path is a\/path\/to\/cache , you can ignore a\/path\/to\/cache\/.ignore-me , unless that’s the only file inside a\/path\/to\/cache . " },

New Env Vars take effect from the next Step Any Environment Variable you create with the envman tool takes effect only from the subsequent Step in the Workflow. In other words, you can't use a newly created Environment Variable in the same Step in which it was created. Here is a simple example where we're using envman to add a new Env Var with the key MY_RELEASE_NOTE : envman add --key MY_RELEASE_NOTE --value \"This is the release note\" You can call envman in any Step, including a Script Step, or even in your own script (stored in your repository) if you call it from a bitrise build. You can specify the value as the --value parameter, or by using pipe: echo 'hi' | envman add --key MY_RELEASE_NOTE You can also read the value from a file: envman add --key MY_RELEASE_NOTE --valuefile .\/some\/file\/path Once the Env Var is exposed, you can use it like any other Env Var. You can use these exposed Env Vars in the inputs of other Steps as well. Here is an example where we’re exposing the release note Env Var and then using it in another Script Step and in a Send a Slack message Step: workflows:\n example:\n steps:\n - script:\n inputs:\n - content: |\n #!\/bin\/bash\n envman add --key MY_RELEASE_NOTE --value \"This is the release note\"\n - script:\n inputs:\n - content: |\n #!\/bin\/bash\n echo \"My Release Note: $MY_RELEASE_NOTE\"\n - slack:\n inputs:\n - channel: ...\n - webhook_url: ...\n - message: \"Release Note: $MY_RELEASE_NOTE\" If you want to expose the value of an Env Var to be accessible through the key of another Env Var, you can do so. For example, to expose the value of BITRISE_BUILD_NUMBER under the key MY_BUILD_NUMBER :  envman add --key MY_BUILD_NUMBER --value \"${BITRISE_BUILD_NUMBER}\" After this, subsequent Steps can get the value of BITRISE_BUILD_NUMBER from the MY_BUILD_NUMBER Env Var. If you change the value of BITRISE_BUILD_NUMBER after this, the value of MY_BUILD_NUMBER won’t be modified, it will still hold the original value! If you need to know if a custom Env Var has been defined, you can easily check it, and even overwrite its value: #!\/bin\/bash\nset -ex\nif [ ! -z \"$API_PROJECT_SCHEME\" ] ; then\n envman add --key PROJECT_SCHEME --value \"$API_PROJECT_SCHEME\"\nfi This script checks whether the API_PROJECT_SCHEME Env Var is defined, and if it is, its value will be assigned to the PROJECT_SCHEME Environment Variable, overwriting the original value of PROJECT_SCHEME .

"body" : "By default, all Secrets are handled on the app level. You can reuse Secret keys across multiple Bitrise apps, even if their corresponding values are different for each app. However, it is possible to set up a Secret that holds the same value for all your apps, and manage that Secret from one location. For example, if all your apps need access to the same API, it makes sense to store the Secret containing the API key in a central location. If the API key ever changes, you only need to change it in that single location and the change applies to all your Bitrise apps. Setting up such a Secret (or multiple Secrets) requires two things: A central vault or database - such as HashiCorp or Doppler - to store the Secrets. It must be accessible via a CLI. A Script Step to access the central vault\/database, pull the Secret and set it to sensitive on Bitrise. To create a new Secret and store it in a central location during a build: Add the Secrets as a key-value pair to your vault or database where you want to store them. Add a Script Step to ALL Workflows where you want to use the Secrets. Add the necessary commands to access your vault and pull the Secrets. The exact commands depend on the service you’re using. Use the envman tool to mark the Secrets as sensitive. The envman tool has the following syntax: envman add --key KEY --value value --sensitive . Make sure the Step doesn’t display the value of the Secret in the build log. To do so, remove set -x from the Step’s content . Secret redaction Please note that if you have Secret redaction turned off, your Secrets will not be redacted and thus their value can still be visible in logs. Storing your Secrets in a HashiCorp Vault Let’s say you have a HashiCorp Vault instance called secret\/hello . You have two Secrets in this vault instance: foo with the value world and foo2 with the value world2 . To use these Secrets in a Bitrise build, you need to: Export them from the Vault instance. Iterate over them and mark both of them as sensitive. You can use this Script to achieve both: # Exporting the Secrets\nvault kv get --format=json secret\/hello | jq -r '.data.data | to_entries[] | [.key, .value] | @tsv' | \n# Iterating over the Secrets and marking them as sensitive\nwhile IFS=$'\\t' read -r key value; do\n envman add --key \"$key\" --value \"$value\" --sensitive\ndone " },

On the Builds page, you can track the current status of all your builds. There are six different build statuses: On hold : There are more builds started than what your current plan allows. In most cases, this is only relevant for legacy, concurrency-based plans: it means you don't have enough concurrency to start another build. Starting : When a build is triggered, Bitrise creates a virtual machine to run it. If computing resources aren’t immediately available, the build is placed in a queue. Once a worker is available, the worker assigned to create the virtual machine is processing the build request. Running : Once a virtual machine is ready to go, the build starts running. This means that Bitrise is executing all the Steps defined in your Workflow. Aborted : A build can be aborted manually by the user, or automatically either by the Rolling builds feature or because your build time has run out. Aborted with success There is a specific status called Aborted with success: this means the build has been aborted by the API but it is reported as a success to your git hosting provider. Use the  abort_with_success  parameter with a Bitrise API call to abort a build but still count it as a successful one. Failed : In most cases, a build fails if any of the Steps fails. There are exceptions, such as the caching Steps , and you can mark Steps as skippable which means even if they fail, the build will keep running. Success : If Bitrise successfully executes all Steps that aren’t marked as skippable, the build is marked as successful. You can always check your build status on the Builds page of the app, and you can send status reports: Reporting the build status to your Git hosting provider" },

Add a Script step to your Workflow, and either write your script there, or run a script from your repository. Passwordless sudo is enabled in all of our build virtual machines, so you can freely use sudo if you need it.

In the Search steps bar, search for “script” and click on the Script Step . This will add the Step to your Workflow. Click the Step in your Workflow. Insert your script into the Script content input field. Running a script from your repository If you want to run a script from your repository, you can run it from this Script Step. Paths are relative to your repository’s root. For example, if you have a Bash script at path\/to\/script.sh you can add it to the Script content input field and run it with the following command: #!\/bin\/bash\nset -ex\nbash .\/path\/to\/script.sh You can run non-Bash scripts too, for example, a Ruby script : #!\/bin\/bash\nset -ex\nruby .\/path\/to\/script.rb Installing cmake on macOS Install cmake with a Script Step on macOS with the following brew command: #!\/bin\/bash\nset -ex\nbrew install cmake Brew install You can also use the Brew install Step to install cmake and many other tools. Installing cmake on Linux Install cmake with a Script Step on Linux with the following apt-get command: #!\/bin\/bash\nset -ex\nsudo apt-get install -y cmake Use the -y flag for apt-get If you don’t add the -y (yes) flag to the apt-get command, apt-get will present a prompt which you have to accept or deny manually. This is not a problem on your own Linux machine but in a CI environment you can’t provide manual input for apt-get .

You can create a signed APK using the  Android Sign   Step in your Bitrise Workflow . This Step is configured to run if you have already uploaded your keystore file on the  Code Signing  tab of the Workflow Editor. The  Android Sign  Step is not required if signing is configured in your project’s build.gradle file. If so, running the  Android Build Step (or the  Gradle Runner  Step) signs the output (APK or AAB) automatically. Nevertheless, we recommend that you use the  Android Sign  Step to sign your project in an easy and secure way. jarsign and apksigner APKs can be signed with either jarsigner or apksigner . For APKs, if you wish to use apksigner to sign your project, then in the Android Sign Step you have to first set the Enables apksigner input to true and leave the APK Signature Scheme input on automatic. This way apksigner checks your APK’s minimum and target SDK versions and chooses the required schemes. It signs your project with V1 scheme if your minimum supported version is low and it also signs with other schemes for newer systems. Please note that AAB files can only be signed with jarsigner. The Step uses jarsigner if it detects a file ending with  .aab Open your app on Bitrise . Click the Workflows button on the main page. Go to Code Signing > Android Code Signing . Drag-and-drop your keystore file to the  Upload file  field of the  ANDROID KEYSTORE FILE  section. A keystore URL automatically gets generated once you upload the keystore file. Bitrise assigns an Environment Variable ( BITRISEIO_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_URL ) to the download URL (which is a time-limited, read-only download URL) of the file as the value. No need to download it manually as the Android Sign Step downloads it automatically. Fill out the displayed three input fields with your credentials: Keystore password Keystore alias Private key password Click Save metadata . When you have successfully uploaded a keystore file to the ANDROID KEYSTORE FILE section, Bitrise will automatically export the following Environment Variables based on your input: $BITRISEIO_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_ALIAS $BITRISEIO_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD $BITRISEIO_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD $BITRISEIO_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_URL Add the Android Sign Step to your Workflow after the Step that builds your APK or AAB file. Bitrise uses the above Environment Variables and sets them as inputs into the respective fields of the  Android Sign  Step. Once the Step runs, it produces either a signed APK or an AAB. The signed APK or AAB is used in deploy Steps, for example, the  Google Play Deploy  Step or the  Deploy to Bitrise.io  Step. The latter deploys the APK\/AAB on the Artifacts  tab. You can also use Ship to deploy your app once you built an APK\/AAB file. Downloading your keystore file You can download your keystore file to the project directory from the ANDROID KEYSTORE FILE section using the  File Downloader  Step: - file-downloader:\n inputs:\n - source: $BITRISEIO_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_URL\n - destination: \"$HOME\/keystores\/my_keystore.jks\" #native android# If a Step requires the keystore file, make sure to include that Step AFTER the File Downloader Step.

A keystore file is required for Android code signing. You can define the location of the keystore file of an Android app in your build.gradle file. If the keystore file itself is missing from the location, you can use one of our file downloading Steps to download the keystore file from Bitrise and put it in the defined location. Bitrise has two Steps which download files from the Code Signing tab. Which one to use in your workflow depends on where you uploaded your keystore file in the Code Signing tab: File Downloader Step: If you have uploaded your keystore file to the ANDROID KEYSTORE FILE section, which is the recommended place for your keystore file, this is the Step you should use. Once the file is uploaded, Bitrise assigns an Environment Variable ( BITRISEIO_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_URL ) to the download URL (which is a time-limited, read-only download URL) of the file as the value. Generic File Storage Step: If you have uploaded your keystore file to the GENERIC FILE STORAGE section on the Code Signing tab, this is the Step you should use. Bitrise assigns an Environment Variable ( $GENERIC_FILE_STORAGE ) to the download URL (which is a time-limited, read-only download URL) of the file as the value. If you use an Environment Variable in your build.gradle file, you can use a Script Step to overwrite the Environment Variable’s value with the destination path defined in the $GENERIC_FILE_STORAGE Environment Variable. Make sure you use envman and not just a simple export. Add either the File Downloader or the Generic File Storage Step to your workflow. The Step should be added BEFORE the Gradle Runner Step. If you use the File Downloader Step, fill out the following 2 input fields: Download source url : Set the generated keystore URL you get when you upload your file to the ANDROID KEYSTORE FILE section of the Code Signing tab). Download destination path : Set the location of the keystore file as a relative path. This path should be the same as the keystore path already defined in your build.gradle file (for example, $HOME\/keystores\/project_release.keystore ). Add the Gradle Runner Step right after your file downloading Step. With that said, if you have successfully added the Steps to download your keystore file to the same location that you specified in your build.gradle file, you do not need the Android Sign Step in your workflow. Our Gradle Runner Step will sign and assemble your project. " },

Setting up iOS code signing on Bitrise Methods How it works When to use it Automatically managed provisioning profiles (recommended) You only need to upload the code signing certificate(s) to Bitrise and to establish an Apple Service connection (either via App Store Connect API key or through an Apple ID). Bitrise will download, create or renew the provisioning profile(s) and handle App ID and test device registration automatically. This is the recommended option for most apps. With this option, managing your provisioning profiles is seamless and it's much easier to set up your Workflows. Manually managed provisioning profiles You need to upload the code signing certificate(s) and also the provisioning profile(s) to Bitrise and keep the provisioning profile(s) updated with your iOS project. Choose this option if: You cannot connect your App Store Connect API key or Apple ID to Bitrise. You store or handle your code signing files in a unique way. You wish to use code signing files from multiple Apple Developer Accounts. You might also prefer this option if you are using an account with Apple Developer Enterprise Program. In this case only Apple ID-based authentication is supported. This has certain limitations: for example, needs to be renewed every 30 days.

The certificates - development or distribution - are the guarantee that you, the named developer, built this code, that you are a member of the developer program, and that Apple have issued you with a certificate to do so. To get a certificate, you need to generate a Certificate Signing Request with Keychain Access and send it to Apple. This will create a public\/private key pair for you if you don’t have one already.

Beta status Please note that currently, both Steps are in beta phase. They are already stable and work well but we’re working on improving them! The Xcode Build for testing for iOS Step performs the xcodebuild command’s build-for-testing action: it builds the tests defined in your iOS app’s Xcode scheme . The Step exports a .zip file that contains your test directory (by default, it’s Debug-iphoneos ) and the xctestrun file. To use this Step, you will need code signing files for the test app: we recommend using codesigndoc to export the necessary files! The iOS Device Testing Step takes the path to this .zip file - exported as an Environment Variable - as input to run your tests and export the test results to Bitrise. Automatic vs manual code signing asset management The Xcode Build for testing for iOS Step can manage your code signing assets without you having to manually manage your provisioning profiles. This only requires you to select the relevant inputs in the Step (see below) and upload the right certificates to the Code Signing tab. This is the automatic code signing asset management method. If you decide to chose the manual code signing asset management, then add the Add the Certificate and Profile Installer Step before the Xcode Build for testing for iOS Step. The former will take care of the code signing asset management while the latter builds your project. Make sure the Automatic code signing method input of the Xcode Build for testing for iOS Step is set to off . The instructions below detail the steps of setting up automatic code signing asset management on Bitrise with the Xcode Build for testing for iOS Step. Add the Xcode Build for testing for iOS Step to your Workflow. Note that it should come AFTER the Certificate and profile installer Step. In the Scheme name input, set the Xcode Scheme you want to use. By default, the value of the input is the $BITRISE_SCHEME Environment Variable which is stored when your app is created. By default, the scheme defines which configuration - for example, Debug or Release - will be used. In the Configuration name input, you can define the configuration type manually. Set a destination option for xcodebuild in the Device destination input of the Step.The default value is generic\/platform=ios . For the available values, call man xcodebuild on your local machine and check the Destinations section of the printout. Set the Automatic code signing method input to the Apple service connection you want to use for code signing. The available options are: off if you don’t do automatic code signing. api-key if you use API key authorization . apple-id if you use Apple ID authorization .

Test Reports can read and display test results that are in either of two formats: You can use Test Reports with five of our testing Steps by default. These Steps will run the tests defined in your repository and then store the output in an Environment Variable. The Deploy to Bitrise.io Step will do the rest: it can read the results and send it to Test Reports. The Steps are: Xcode Test for iOS . Android Unit Test . iOS Device Testing .

Example patterns: If your app’s root directory is app: app\/build\/test-results\/testDemoDebugUnitTest\/ If your test results are within an app folder but app is not the root directory: .\/app\/build\/test-results\/testDemoDebugUnitTest\/ In the Test result search pattern input, set a pattern that matches your test result file. This search pattern is used to search every file and folder of the path that was set in the Path where custom test results reside input. If there is more than one match, the Step will export the first match with a warning in the logs. If you set a specific filepath in the previous input, just set * here. Example patterns: Matching all files within the base path: * Matching all files within a given directory of the base path: *\/build\/test-results\/testDemoDebugUnitTest\/* In the Step’s test result directory input, make sure the path is correct.

The available options are: off if you don’t do automatic code signing. api-key if you use API key authorization . apple-id if you use Apple ID authorization . Set the Distribution method input of the Step to development . You can use other export methods, too, but if you only deploy to Bitrise and want to install your app on the specified devices of internal testers, development is sufficient. Make sure the Deploy to Bitrise.io Step is in your Workflow. By default, the value of the Enable public page for the App? input is set to true . This way, once the build runs, a public install page will be available with a long and random URL which can be shared with others who are not registered on Bitrise. This URL is sent to the users in an email. The Notify: User Roles and the Notify: Emails inputs determine which users get the email. Start a build. When the build is finished, go to the app’s Builds page and click the latest build. Click the Artifacts tab to find your IPA file. You can also find the public install URL here. Click the eye icon next to the IPA file to reveal the details and to find the toggle for the public install page. Make sure that’s toggled on so you’re able to send the link to non-Bitrise users. To install an app from the public install page, you must use a native Safari browser of the iOS device. You cannot click the installation link if you’re browsing from a third-party app. And that’s it! The file can now be installed on all the devices included in the app’s provisioning profile. Remember: the installation link must be accessed from an iOS device’s Safari browser! " },

To see more details, please visit DeployGate Features . To upload your app to DeployGate, add the DeployGate Upload Step to your bitrise Workflow . This Step should be added after the Step that builds your app's binary that will be uploaded. You need to set several required parameters as below: Input Variables Description API Key Set upload user’s DeployGate API Key from Account Settings. If you want to upload apps as organization account, please use organization’s API Key. Upload account will be shown on the activity timeline. Owner Name App owner’s account name in DeployGate. You can use username or organization name. App file path App’s binary file (IPA\/APK) to be uploaded. For default setting, use $BITRISE_APK_PATH for Android or $BITRISE_IPA_PATH for iOS You can also set optional variables for using advanced features as below: Input Variables Description Short Message Summary of update shown on DeployGate. You can use $BITRISE_GIT_MESSAGE if you want to use the commit message, the pull request title, or the message you specified when you triggered the build manually. Distribution Key You can make multiple public install links (we called it Distribution Page) for a different version of app binary in the same app. By specifying the distribution page’s hash, that distribution page will be updated simultaneously. The “xxxx” portion of the distributed page’s URL like https:\/\/deploygate.com\/distributions\/xxxx Distribution Name Specify the name of the updated distribution page. If nothing exists, a new distribution page will be created. Possible usage includes creating distribution pages for each Git branch name. (for example $BITRISE_GIT_BRANCH) Release Note Message for the new release in distribution page. This message will be notified to your distribution page’s testers Disable Notify(iOS Only) There is no DeployGate client app in iOS platform. By default, we use email notifications for release updates. If you don’t need email notification, please set this option as true These options are based on DeployGate API . For more details, please read the references at DeployGate.com . You can use DeployGate's Distribution Page (Shareable link) feature to generate a landing page for the app installation of your app’s specific version. When you upload an app to DeployGate, the system automatically assigns a sequential number (we are calling it **Revision Number** ) for each uploaded build. On the Distribution Page, you can choose specific revision of app to distribute for each group of testers. This feature is handy for distributing your app to multiple tester groups for different purposes such as QAs, Dog Fooding, or Test Marketing. You can also generate a distribution page when you upload an app from Bitrise with DeployGate Upload Step. Please refer to the optional variables above. " },

You can create a bitrise.yml file in advance and use that, or have our project scanner scan your project and generate one for you. You can easily register a new Bitrise app from any command line interface: the process is guided and simple to follow. And it’s fast: if, for example, you have the bitrise.yml file you want to use for the app, you do not have to wait for the project scanner to detect the app type and generate your bitrise.yml file. Just plug in the existing file and you are good to go! Adding an app with the API You can also use the Bitrise API to add a new app: Adding and managing appsBefore you try adding a new app to Bitrise via our CLI, make sure a few things are in order: You need a Bitrise account, with a connected Git provider. Your project must have a local Git repository on your machine and a remote repository at a Git provider. If you want to use an SSH key to access the repository, the remote repository URL must be an SSH URL ! For example, git@github.com:example-user\/example.git . You can also create a bitrise.yml in advance and you will be able to add that to your app during the creation process. This is optional: you can have the project scanner generate one for you during the process, just like on our website! This procedure guides you through adding an app which Bitrise will access with an SSH key. This requires that the app’s remote repository has an SSH URL, such as git@github.com:example-user\/example.git . You can, of course, use an HTTPS URL to access your remote repository, too: in that case, you will not set an SSH key for your app. We only recommend using HTTPS URLs for public apps (open source projects). Go to the Create New App from CLI page. You can reach this page from your Dashboard : click the Add new app button on the right, and then select Add New App from CLI . Set the account that will own the app, and the privacy of the app. Copy the curl command you find there. Open a command line interface. Change the directory to your project’s location. Paste the curl command and hit Enter . Select the repository URL: choose the SSH option. This prompt only comes up if your local repository’s remote has an SSH URL. If the remote repository has an HTTPS URL, you won’t see this prompt. Remote URL: git@github.com:example-user\/example.git\n\n? Select repository URL::\n https:\/\/github.com\/example-user\/example.git\n > ssh:\/\/git@github.com:example-user\/example.git\n Register an SSH key. Specify how Bitrise will be able to access the source code: \n > Automatic\n Add own SSH You can select either the automatic registration or choose to add your own. If you choose automatic, Bitrise will automatically generate a key pair. If you need to use additional private repositories or submodules, choose the I need to option when prompted and follow the instructions. If not, select the No, auto-add SSH key option: this automatically adds the public key to your repository. If you choose to add your own, you have to provide the path to the SSH key file: either enter it manually, or drag and drop the file, as that will input the path. Decide what bitrise.yml file you want to upload. ? What bitrise.yml do you want to upload? \n > Run the scanner to generate a new bitrise.yml\n Use the bitrise.yml found in the current directory or specify manually You can either have the scanner generate one based on your project files or you can provide a file. If your repository already contains a bitrise.yml file, the path to it will be automatically filled in. Select the branch you want to use. The default option is the current active branch. The current branch is: master (tracking: origin master),\n \n? Do you want to run the scanner for this branch?\n > Yes\n No\n If you select No , you will be prompted to check out the branch you wish to use, and then hit Enter again so the scanner can start. Once the scanner is done, it will either detect your app’s type or it will switch to manual configuration. Manual configuration means you have to select the type of your app (iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, and so on) and you have to provide the path to the relevant configuration file. For example, a config.xml in the case of an Ionic app. In this guide, we’ll proceed with automatic detection. Select the stack you want to use. If the scanner detects your project type, a stack will be automatically recommended but you can change it in the CLI if you want to. If you performed manual configuration as described above, you will have to choose the stack, too. Finish the process with setting up webhooks and code signing files. You can decide to skip webhook registration but it’s required to automatically trigger builds on Bitrise. For more information: WebhooksYou can upload code signing files: depending on your app’s type, you will be asked if you want to upload iOS code signing files - the tool will run codesigndoc for you - and\/or an Android keystore file. You can upload these files any time on the website. For more information: Code signingAnd that’s it! You are done: the URL to your new app will be printed out, and you can also view the app on your Dashboard . " },

By using the API, you gain the ability to fully customize Bitrise’s functionality to fit your process. The API is work-in-progress The API is work-in-progress: we will add new endpoints and possibly update the existing ones in the future. You can track the progress of the API: join the discussion ! Follow it and get notified about new endpoints and changes, we announce those there. Feel free to contribute! If you want to request a new API feature or a new endpoint, you can do so! The Bitrise API’s host is: https:\/\/api.bitrise.io\/ Every endpoint except the root one is versioned. The version has to be included in the URL right after the host: for example, https:\/\/api.bitrise.io\/v0.1\/me is the endpoint for your own user account. Right now we have only one version, v0.1 . There’s no long term compatibility promise for v0.1 , although we try to do our best to not to break anything unless we have to. Once we’re happy with v0.1 we’ll “freeze” it as v1.0 , for which we’ll provide long term support. " },

Owner or Admin Apps with HTTPS Git URLs The procedure and the examples are aimed at adding a private app with an SSH git URL. If you want to add an app with an HTTPS git URL, you can skip adding an SSH key. Register the app by calling the register endpoint and setting all required parameters. You need to set your git provider, the repository URL, the slug of the repository as it appears at the provider, and the slug of the owner of the repository. You also need to add the slug of the Workspace that will own the app: due to legacy naming conventions, you need the organization_slug parameter. curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: ACCESS-TOKEN' 'https:\/\/api.bitrise.io\/v0.1\/apps\/register' -d \\\n'{\n \"provider\": \"github\",\n \"is_public\": false,\n \"organization_slug\": \"$ORG_SLUG\"\n \"repo_url\": \"git@github.com:api_demo\/example-repository.git\",\n \"type\": \"git\",\n \"git_repo_slug\": \"example-repository\",\n \"git_owner\": \"api_demo\"\n }' Changing the name of your app By default, when you register an app, it will inherit the name of your git repository. If you would like to add the app with a different name, you can append the \"title\" parameter to your POST request using the following syntax: curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: ACCESS-TOKEN' 'https:\/\/api.bitrise.io\/v0.1\/apps\/register' -d \\\n'{\n ...\n ...\n \"title\": \"string\"\n }'\n You can also change the name of your app after creating it, by sending a PATCH request and calling the apps endpoint. For more information, see Managing an existing app . Once done, call the register-ssh-key endpoint to set up the SSH keys you created so that Bitrise can clone your repository when running a build. You need to provide both your private and public SSH key. Please note that if you wish to copy the private key manually, you need to escape all the line breaks with \\n . You can also set whether you want to automatically register the public key at your git provider: set the is_register_key_into_provider_service parameter to either true or false. curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: ACCESS-TOKEN' 'https:\/\/api.bitrise.io\/v0.1\/apps\/APP-SLUG\/register-ssh-key' -d \\\n'{\n \"auth_ssh_private_key\": \"your-private-ssh-key\",\n \"auth_ssh_public_key\": \"your-public-ssh-key\",\n \"is_register_key_into_provider_service\": false\n }' Finish the app registration process by calling the finish endpoint. This endpoint allows you to configure your apps: set the project type, the stack on which the build will run (this may vary based on your app), and the initial configuration settings. You can also set Environment Variables, as well as immediately specify a Workspace that will be the owner of the application. Please note that the mode parameter must be set to the value of manual . curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: ACCESS-TOKEN' 'https:\/\/api.bitrise.io\/v0.1\/apps\/APP-SLUG\/finish' -d \\\n'{\n \"project_type\": \"ios\",\n \"stack_id\": \"osx-xcode-13.2.x\",\n \"config\": \"default-ios-config\",\n \"mode\": \"manual\",\n \"envs\": {\n \"env1\": \"val1\",\n \"env2\": \"val2\"\n },\n \"organization_slug\": \"e1ec3dea540bcf21\"\n }'\n " },

The bitrise.yml file is the heart of your Bitrise configuration. The Bitrise CLI needs this file to be able to run Bitrise builds, either locally or on our website. A bare minimal bitrise.yml is as simple as: format_version: 11 The above configuration is valid but does not include anything to execute with run . A minimal configuration which you can bitrise run : format_version: 5\nworkflows:\n test: The above configuration can be executed with bitrise run test . The Bitrise CLI won’t give you any errors, but there’s still nothing declared to do. Let’s continue with an example that executes a single Script Step when you run it with bitrise run test . format_version: 11\ndefault_step_lib_source: https:\/\/github.com\/bitrise-io\/bitrise-steplib.git\nproject_type: android\napp:\n envs:\n - MY_NAME: My Name\nworkflows:\n test:\n steps:\n - script@1.1.5:\n inputs:\n - content: echo \"Hello ${MY_NAME}!\" A quick walk through of this sample configuration: format_version : declares the minimum Bitrise CLI format version. Get your Bitrise CLI’s supported highest format version with bitrise version --full . Format version number The format version number determines what Bitrise CLI versions will be able to run the configuration. For example, if you set the format_version to 11 that means that Bitrise CLI versions which don’t support the format version 11 or higher won’t be able to run the configuration. This is important if you use features which are not available in older Bitrise CLI versions. default_step_lib_source : specifies the source to use when no other source is defined for a Step. project_type : defines your source project’s type (for example, android , ios , flutter ). app - envs : specifies the Environment Variables (Env Var) which will be available for every build, workflow and step. workflows : is the collection of separate build configurations which you can run with bitrise run WORKFLOWID . In our example the only workflow is test , which you can perform with bitrise run test . If you’d have a second workflow called main , you could run both bitrise run test and bitrise run main . steps : lists the Steps which should be executed when the Workflow is run. In our example the test workflow includes only a single script Step. If multiple Steps are declared, they are performed one by one. script@1.1.5 : a Step (reference) to perform. This reference does not have a StepLib Source declaration, which means that the default_step_lib_source will be used as the StepLib Source. inputs : specifies Step inputs. Multiple inputs A Step can have many inputs. Specify only those input in the bitrise.yml which you want to set or overwrite. content : the input you want to set. In our example, we specified the content of the Script Step. echo \"Hello ${MY_NAME}!\" : this is the value we specified for the content input. bitrise.yml size limitation If you edit your Workflow on bitrise.io (either in the Workflow Editor or on the bitrise.yml tab) and your bitrise.yml exceeds its size limitation, the UI will display the following warning upon trying to save your changes: Error saving!

For example, when you select a different stack for your Workflow than the default stack. Just click Workflow Editor on the UI and pick another stack type for your Workflow\/s on the Stacks & Machines tab. This way you can test how your Workflow runs in the new Stack. If you head back to the bitrise.yml tab, a bitrise.io meta is added to the deploy Workflow: workflows:\n deploy:\n steps:\n - activate-ssh-key@4.0.3:\n run_if: '{{getenv \"SSH_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY\" | ne \"\"}}'\n - git-clone@4.0.11: {}\n - script@1.1.5:\n title: Do anything with Script step\n - deploy-to-bitrise-io@1.3.15: {}\n meta:\n bitrise.io:\n stack: osx-xcode-12.1.x\n Since this meta is only interpreted on bitrise.io and not locally or on the Bitrise CLI, it is categorized by a bitrise.io namespace (where the stack is the key and osx-xcode-12.1.x is the value). The Workflow Editor always validates the saved variable and throws an error if there is a syntax error, but with meta added, its content is fully ignored by the Workflow Editor validation process.

It just means that no Step will be executed here and the build will continue with the next Workflow in the chain). send-notifications bitrise run deploy : will execute the Steps of the Workflows in the following order: setup test deploy send-notifications This means that you can define what a setup and test should do in your project in the setup and test Workflows only once, and then you can reuse those in other Workflows. There’s no need to duplicate Steps between Workflows. The Bitrise CLI supports a small notation, called utility Workflow: a Workflow whose ID starts with an underscore character, for example, _setup . A utility Workflow can't be executed directly with a bitrise run command: they can be referenced with before_run and after_run properties.

You can check out the default outputs of a Step in the Workflow Editor on bitrise.io or in the step.yml file of the Step. Step outputs are environment items that are the result of running a given Step. For example, the Deploy to Bitrise.io Step generates two output envs by default: $BITRISE_PUBLIC_INSTALL_PAGE_URL BITRISE_PUBLIC_INSTALL_PAGE_URL_MAP You can check out the default outputs of a Step in the Workflow Editor on bitrise.io or in the step.yml file of the Step. Step outputs can be defined in the step.yml file of the project by setting the outputs attribute. They have the same syntax as every environment property. It consists of two main parts: a KEY: value pair and an opts field. The key and the value are required, the opts field is optional. - MY_KEY_FOR_THE_ENV: my value for the env\n opts:\n title: An example env var item\n is_dont_change_value: false\n category: example MY_KEY_FOR_THE_ENV : The key of the environment item (required). my value for the env : The value of the item (required). opts : Optional attributes. The default outputs of a Step cannot be changed by the user in the bitrise.yml file of the project: they can only be changed in the step.yml file. However, you can export the output in a custom Environment Variable . This is useful, for example, if you have the same step twice in your Workflow and you wish to use the generated output of both steps: workflows:\n primary:\n steps:\n - gradle-runner:\n outputs:\n - BITRISE_APK_PATH: ALIAS_APK_PATH\n In this example, the value for the BITRISE_APK_PATH Environment Variable will be exported under the ALIAS_APK_PATH key.

Environment Variables (Env Vars) consist of a key and a value. They can also include optional attributes. They can be defined on the level of apps , Workflows or Steps . You can set your own Env Vars but there is a selection of Env Vars that are exposed automatically by either the Bitrise CLI or bitrise.io . Env Vars exposed by the Bitrise CLI are available everywhere, even if you run the build on your own computer. Env Vars exposed by bitrise.io are available for builds running on bitrise.io virtual machines. Pipeline Env Vars exposed by bitrise.io are only available for Pipeline builds running on bitrise.io virtual machines. Step outputs exposed as Env Vars Steps can also expose Step outputs as Env Vars. For example, a Step that builds a binary can expose that binary to other Steps as an Env Var. As basically any Bitrise Step can expose outputs this way, we won't list them all but you can find all Environment Variables related to the git cloning process: Table 4, “. Env Vars exposed by the Bitrise CLI Env Var key Description $BITRISE_TRIGGERED_WORKFLOW_ID The ID of the Workflow that was triggered . This Env Var is exposed regardless of whether the Workflow was triggered manually or automatically. $BITRISE_TRIGGERED_WORKFLOW_TITLE The title of the Workflow that was triggered. This Env Var is exposed regardless of whether the Workflow was triggered manually or automatically. $BITRISE_BUILD_STATUS The current status of the build. The available options are: 0: Successful. 1: Failed. A successful current status means that none of the previous Steps in the build failed. $BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR Path to the base working directory. By default, it’s the directory where Bitrise runs, unless you provide a different value. This can be overwritten during the build, which will change the working directory for subsequent Steps in the build. $BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR Path to the directory that stores artifacts and files for deployment. It’s a temporary directory created by the Bitrise CLI by default, and can be overwritten before starting the Bitrise CLI. The Deploy to Bitrise.io Step looks for your build artifacts - such as an IPA or APK of the app -, test results, and other files in this directory. $CI Indicates whether the Bitrise CLI is running in Continuous Integration mode. The possible values are: true false $PR Indicates whether the Bitrise CLI is running in PR (Pull Request) mode. Running in Pull Request mode means that Bitrise builds your code in the state as if the Pull Request was already merged. The possible values are: true false Env Vars exposed by bitrise.io Env Var key Description $BITRISE_BUILD_NUMBER Build number of the build on bitrise.io . $BITRISE_APP_TITLE The title of your app on bitrise.io . You can change it any time on the Settings tab of the app. $BITRISE_APP_URL The URL or your app on bitrise.io . This is not the same as the git repository URL! An app URL has the following format: app.bitrise.io\/APP-SLUG\/ For example: https:\/\/app.bitrise.io\/app\/31e481ce08e0xfd9. $BITRISE_APP_SLUG The slug that uniquely identifies your app on bitrise.io . It’s part of the app URL, too. $BITRISE_BUILD_URL The URL of the build on bitrise.io . $BITRISE_BUILD_SLUG The slug that uniquely identifies a build on bitrise.io . It’s part of the build URL, too. For example, let’s take a look at this build URL: https:\/\/app.bitrise.io\/build\/d75abbebxfc9ca4e. The build slug is d65abbebxfc9ca4e in this example. $BITRISE_BUILD_TRIGGER_TIMESTAMP The date and time when the build was triggered. $GIT_REPOSITORY_URL The URL of the Git repository that hosts your app. This can be changed in the Settings tab of the app. It can be in either SSH or HTTPS format. $BITRISE_GIT_BRANCH The git branch that is built by Bitrise. For example, main . $BITRISEIO_GIT_BRANCH_DEST Used only with builds triggered by pull requests: the destination\/target branch of the pull request that triggered the build. For example, a pull request wants to merge the content of a branch into the branch main . In this case, this Env Var’s value is main . $BITRISE_GIT_TAG If a build is triggered by a Git Tag, this Env Var stores the tag used. $BITRISE_GIT_COMMIT The commit hash of the Git commit that triggered the build, when applicable. $BITRISE_GIT_MESSAGE The commit message, pull request title, or the message you specified if you triggered the build manually. $BITRISEIO_GIT_REPOSITORY_OWNER The owner of the Git repository of the app. $BITRISEIO_GIT_REPOSITORY_SLUG The slug of the Git repository of the app. $BITRISE_PULL_REQUEST The ID of the pull request that triggered a build. $BITRISEIO_PULL_REQUEST_REPOSITORY_URL The URL of the repository from where the pull request that triggered a build has been sent. $BITRISEIO_PULL_REQUEST_MERGE_BRANCH The pre-merge branch - if the Git hosting provider supports and provides the pre-merged state of a pull request on a special merge branch. $BITRISEIO_PULL_REQUEST_HEAD_BRANCH The pull request head branch, if the Git hosting provider system supports and provides this. This special git ref should point to the source of the pull request. $BITRISE_PROVISION_URL The URL of the Apple provisioning profiles uploaded to bitrise.io . If there is more than one provisioning profile uploaded for your app, a pipe character ( | ) separates the URLs in the list. This is only relevant for iOS apps and for cross-platform apps with iOS versions. $BITRISE_CERTIFICATE_URL The URL of the Apple certificates uploaded to bitrise.io . If there is more than one certificate uploaded for your app, a pipe character ( | ) separates the URLs in the list. This is only relevant for iOS apps and for cross-platform apps with iOS versions. $BITRISE_CERTIFICATE_PASSPHRASE The passphrase you set for the uploaded Apple certificates on the app’s Code Signing & Files tab. If there is more than one certificate with a passphrase, a pipe character ( | ) separates the phrases in the list. This is only relevant for iOS apps and for cross-platform apps with iOS versions. $BITRISE_IO Indicates that the build is running in a bitrise.io environment. Value is set to true by Bitrise when it starts a build. Pipeline Env Vars exposed by bitrise.io Env Var key Description $BITRISEIO_PIPELINE_ID The ID of the running Pipeline build. This Env Var is exposed regardless of whether the Pipeline was triggered manually or automatically. $BITRISEIO_PIPELINE_TITLE The name of the running Pipeline build. This Env Var is exposed regardless of whether the Pipeline was triggered manually or automatically. $BITRISEIO_FINISHED_STAGES The status of previously finished Stages and Workflows in a build. Please note that the value of this Env Var may change in the future! $BITRISEIO_PIPELINE_BUILD_STATUS The current status of the Pipeline build.

"body" : "App An app on Bitrise represents a Git repository that stores source code and has been connected to Bitrise to be able to run builds on it. As such, a Bitrise app isn't necessarily an actual application: it's just the code on which you run builds with Bitrise. bitrise.yml The  bitrise.yml  file stores your entire build configuration for an app . It specifies your stack and the build triggers, and defines the Workflows of the app. When you make changes on the graphical UI of our Workflow Editor, you actually modify the  bitrise.yml  file. Pipeline A Bitrise Pipeline is the top level of the Bitrise CI\/CD configuration. Pipelines can be used to organize the entire CI\/CD process and to set up advanced configurations with multiple different tasks running parallel and\/or sequentially. Project scanner The project scanner is a tool that identifies the given project’s type and generates a basic Bitrise configuration. Each supported project type has its own scanner: these scanners are stored as separate packages. Secret A Secret is a specific type of Environment Variable : they hide their information in an encrypted format and their value is not exposed in the build logs nor in the  bitrise.yml  configuration. You can store confidential information, such as passwords or API keys as Secrets. Stack A build stack indicates the full configuration of the virtual machine that Bitrise uses to run your build. Each stack includes an operating system, and a large number of pre-installed software and tools. For example, our Xcode stacks run on macOS operating systems and contain, among many other tools, the Xcode version that is indicated in the name of the stack. Stage A Stage is a collection of Workflows. Stages are the top-level building blocks of Pipelines. A Stage can contain multiple Workflows, which all run in parallel in the same Stage. If all Workflows are successful in a Stage, the Pipeline moves on to the next Stage. If any of the Workflows fail, the Pipeline ends without running the other Stages unless you configure a given Stage to always run. Step A Step is a block of script execution that encapsulates a build task on Bitrise: the code to perform that task, the inputs and parameters you can define for the task, and the outputs the task generates. step.yml The interface definition of a Bitrise Step. It defines the Step inputs and the generated outputs, as well as any other Step property such as the category and the description of the Step. It also points to the Step's source code. Trigger A trigger or build trigger is a configuration for automatically launching a Bitrise build when a specified event happens. Triggers require a webhook set up at your Git hosting provider. Workflow A Workflow is a collection of Steps, Environment Variables, and other configurations. When Bitrise starts a build, it runs one or more Workflows according to the configuration defined in the bitrise.yml file. Workflow Editor WFE The Bitrise Workflow Editor allows you to edit your Workflows, configure Steps, upload files (including code signing files) and manage your app's triggers and stacks on a graphical user interface. It is available both online and offline . Workspace A Workspace is an environment that allows you to manage your Bitrise apps and the team members working on the apps. You can create multiple Workspaces, and you can be invited to Workspaces by other Bitrise users. To be able to add apps and run builds, you either need to be part of a Workspace, or you have to be an outside contributor on an app's team. " },
